6
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:26,067
<i>It's definitely my kind of party.</i>

7
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:29,612
[mysterious voice]
Who dares breach our inner sanctum?

8
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,322
You can take the mask off, Bianca.

9
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:35,452
<i>And just like that, my hopes were dashed</i>

10
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,871
<i>against the rocks</i>
<i>of bitter disappointment.</i>

11
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:40,206
<i>My foe was no psychotic killer.</i>

12
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,459
<i>More like a bunch of high school clowns.</i>

13
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,419
Wait, I preferred you with it on.

14
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:46,713
-How did you get down here?
-Rowan showed me.

15
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:48,840
Left pocket.

16
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,847
I tracked the watermark to the Poe statue.

17
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,308
-Then I solved the riddle.
-Wait, there's a riddle?

18
00:00:58,391 --> 00:00:59,934
I thought we just snapped twice.

19
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,103
Well, aren't you
the brightest in the bunch?

20
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:05,023
The Nightshades are an elite social club.

21
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:06,191
Emphasis on elite.

22
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:09,903
We have roof parties, campouts,
the occasional midnight skinny-dip.

23
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:11,571
And Yoko's an amateur mixologist.

24
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:14,866
She makes a killer virgin mojito.
It can get pretty wild.

25
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:17,660
Wow. Do you guys even have a bedtime?

26
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,371
Last I heard,
the Nightshades had been disbanded.

27
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:25,043
Yeah, the group kind of lost its charter
30 years ago after some normie kid died.

28
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:26,836
[Yoko] But we have
a lot of wealthy alumni,

29
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,714
so Weems looks the other way
as long as nobody makes any waves.

30
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:32,842
-Someone like Rowan?
-We booted that loser last semester.

31
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,346
Question is,
what are we gonna do with her?

32
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,933
Only members are allowed in this library.

33
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:46,314
-I say we invite her to pledge.
-[student] What?

34
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:47,982
She is a legacy.

35
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:51,736
After the crap she pulled in the Poe Cup,
there's no way in hell.

36
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,697
We talk about not making waves?
She's a tsunami.

37
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,118
Just because I beat you at your own game?
Let me save you the trouble.

38
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,828
I'm not interested in joining.

39
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:01,996
You're seriously turning us down?

40
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,289
Can you believe it?

41
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:05,250
Untie her.

42
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,835
I freed myself five minutes ago.

43
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,843
Do you want a matching black eye?

44
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,895
It's amateurs like you
who give kidnapping a bad name.

[Wednesday] <i>There were</i>
<i>so many threads to my investigation,</i>

49
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,171
<i>I could weave a burial shroud.</i>

50
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:55,341
<i>I still have no idea how Rowan</i>
<i>mysteriously rose from the dead.</i>

51
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,468
<i>Or why that monster is prowling the woods.</i>

52
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:01,556
<i>But right now,</i>
<i>nothing intrigues me more than this book.</i>

53

<i>If I'm going to be responsible</i>
<i>for Nevermore's demise,</i>

54
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,769

55
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:10,148
<i>why am I sharing</i>
<i>this apocalypse with a pilgrim?</i>

56
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:13,526

[Weems claps]

58
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,448
All students will report
for their volunteer jobs

59
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:19,866
at 10:00 a.m. sharp,

60
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:22,076
followed by a community lunch at 1:00.

61
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:28,208
As you know, this year Outreach Day
culminates in a very special event,

62
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,920
the dedication of a new memorial statue
in the town square,

63
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:35,965
which will also include
performances by Nevermore students.

64
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,675
[excited giggling]

65
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,053
[Weems] As representatives of our school,

66
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:43,431
I trust you will all
put your best face forward.

67
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,350
-[student 1] Yeah.
-[student 2] Yes!

68
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,443
Yes! I got Pilgrim World.

69
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,112
I have natural people skills
and a love of performing,

70
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,906
so it's kind of the obvi choice.

71
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,407
What'd you get?

72
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,744
Uriah's Heap, whatever that is.

73
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:07,705
Ew. It's this weird, creepy antique store.

74
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:09,499
You'll love it though.

75
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,753
I'm crossing my claws Ajax and I
will be outreaching together.

76
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,297
Oh my God, I got the Weathervane.

77
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,258
Dude, trade with me.
Come on, trade with me!

78
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:22,095
Wednesday, don't worry about your cello.

79
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:24,889
I'll have it brought
to the town square this afternoon.

80
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:26,557
My cello?

81
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,394
I caught your rooftop serenade
the other night.

82
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,187
Impressive.

83
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:35,316
I volunteered you to accompany
the Jericho High School marching band

84
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,234
at the ceremony.

85
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:41,489
I'm sure it won't be too challenging
to play an uplifting Fleetwood Mac melody.

86
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,118
As long as you promise
to hang me as a witch afterwards.

-Why are you staring at a blank wall?
-It wasn't blank last Outreach Day.

91
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,433
Are you still stewing
because I rejected your invitation?

92
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,476
I did go out on a limb for you.

93
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,689
Please. I'm just cannon fodder in whatever
cold war you're waging with Bianca.

94
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:17,025
-I have more pressing issues.
-Like what?

95
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,235
Tracking down the monster
that killed your roommate.

96
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,321
Oh my god.
For the last time, Rowan was expelled.

97
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,614
-Everyone saw him leave.
-Have you spoken to him since?

98
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,744
I texted him a few times,
but I never heard back.

99
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,204
I just figured he wanted
Nevermore in his rearview mirror.

100
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,331
Or he's dead.

101
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,875
I don't know why you care.
It's not like you knew the guy.

102
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,044
I'm not sure why you care so little.

103
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:40,089
People can dismiss me and make a million
other excuses, but I'm not gonna stop.

104
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:44,052
Oh, great. I guess you can
add "thief" to your resume.

105
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:47,263
I don't know what the big deal is about
an old Nightshade's journal anyways.

106
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,099
You didn't seem surprised
when I showed you this last night.

107
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,893
You've seen it before, haven't you?

108
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:55,438
Yeah. A couple days
before the Harvest Festival.

109
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,814
It was open on Rowan's desk.

110
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,817
I assumed he stole it after
we kicked him out of the Nightshades.

111
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:03,654
Then I confronted him about it,
and he kind of went ballistic on me.

112
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,948
-It is unbelievable--
-Shut up!

113
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,325
-How can you?
-You're crazy!

114
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:08,910
[Rowan, Xavier both grunt]

115
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:12,205
He threw you against the wall
with his telekinesis.

116
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:14,499
Yeah.

117
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,751
How did you know that?

118
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,544
Lucky guess.

119
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:24,217
It's weird that you're in this.
This journal is like, what, 30 years old?

120
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,260
What's Crackstone doing
in the picture with you?

121
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,595
You know who that is?

122
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,430
Yeah, it's Joseph Crackstone.

123
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,599
He's, like, Jericho's founding father.

124
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:32,934
He's a big deal around here.

125
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,185
Yeah, look.

126
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,020
That's him.

127
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,692
[chilling music playing]

128
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,699
-Sheriff.
-Yeah.

129
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,410
You remember my son, Lucas?

130
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:54,122
I sure do. I ran into him and his buddies
last week at the Weathervane.

131
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,749
I'd better get to work.

132
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,876
Hey, no trouble today. You got it?

133
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,588
[Galpin groans]

134
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,175
Hey, don't look too excited.

135
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,970
Those outcast kids might think
we're happy to have 'em.

136
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:12,098
We got something lurking in the woods,
connected to that school.

137
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:15,226
Come on, would you stop
pointing fingers at Nevermore?

138
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,437
You know how much Jericho
depends on that place.

139
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,524
Who do you think pays for our roads,
our parks… even your salary?

140
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:25,153
I'm just doing my job, looking out
for the well-being of our town, boss.

141
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,155
Don't lecture me, Donovan.

142
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,657
Before the good citizens of Jericho
elected me mayor,

143
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,284
I used to wear that badge, remember?

144
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,788
Mm-hmm. You never struck me
as much of a history buff back then.

145
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,583
If it's good for business,
then it's good for Jericho.

146
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,751
Especially if your business
is Pilgrim World.

147
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:41,836
Hey.

148
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:45,381
Just find the damn bear
and take care of it.

149
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,509
[Galpin] Mmm.

150
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,344
[Weems] All right. Everyone take a seat.

151
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,638
We have a special announcement.

152
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:53,931
[applause]

153
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,894
Welcome, welcome, Nevermore Academy.

154
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:01,814
Now, on behalf of
the entire Jericho community,

155
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,859
we are so, so pleased
to have you all here today.

156
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:09,071
Your generosity and hard work
are truly… outreachous!

157
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,365
[Walker laughs, clears throat]

158
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:15,953
Okay, everyone. We'll see you
back here at one o'clock for lunch. Enjoy!

159
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:24,587
Enid.

160
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,256
Switch volunteer assignments.

161
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,426
What? No.
Uriah's Heap is definitely not my bag.

162
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,095
It's an emergency.
I need to check out Pilgrim World.

163
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,598
But Wednesday, this is not a fair trade.

164
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:39,227
Why would I agree to spend the entire day
at some dumpy emporium of crapola?

165
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,604
Because Ajax is volunteering there.

166
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,189
Thing sneaked a peek at his assignment.

167
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:44,649
-But if you're not interested--
-No!

168
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,902
Oh my God, thank you. You're the best!

169
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,987
[Enid giggles excitedly]

170
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:56,827
[whimsical, old-timey music playing]

171
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,913
[tourists chattering indistinctly]

172
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:09,048
Welcome to Pilgrim World!

173
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:12,134
Witch trials every day!

174
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,178
Two o'clock, four o'clock!

175
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,097
Hey, man! Woman!

176
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,267
[whimsical, old-timey music playing]

177
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,480
Hey, Wednesday,
want to grab a Hummers group photo?

178
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:27,567
Guess not.

179
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:31,988
Good morrow, my young Nevermore kin.

180
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,700
I am Mistress Arlene. A real OC.

181
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,536
Original colonist.

182
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:42,873
Now prithee, put your cell phones
on vibrate and make haste,

183
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:49,171
for you are about to travel back in time
to the year of our Lord 1625,

184
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,258
to Jericho's first pilgrim settlement.

185
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,011
[whimsical, old-timey music continues]

186
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,057
Yonder.

187
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,476
Behold, the meeting house.

188
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,271
Inside is a collection of artifacts

189
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:09,066
related to Jericho's most beloved
and pious founder,

190
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,568
Joseph Crackstone.

191
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:15,740
And beyond is our privy,
America's first gender-neutral restroom.

192
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,158
I haveth a query.

193
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,701
Pray, be quick, child.

194
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,036
In the meeting house,

195
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,288
which of Joseph Crackstone's artifacts
are on display?

196
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,290
It is truly a treasure trove,

197
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:29,503
including original farm tools, tableware,
even the Crackstone family chamber pot.

198
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:32,256
Sounds fascinating.
I volunteer to work in there.

199
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,967
Pray, no. That exhibit is being renovated.

200
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:40,473
Today, thou will all be working
at the beating heart of Pilgrim World.

201
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,683
[hawker] Ye olde fudgery!

202
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,020
"Ye Olde Fudgery?"

203
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,980
More like ye olde diabetes in a box.

204
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,483
Volunteers, prick up thine ears.

205
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:55,404
Fudge is the lifeblood
of our humble community.

206
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,281
And samples equal sales,

207
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:03,079
so grab a uniform and a box
and make our forefathers proud.

208
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,289
Are these for muzzling tourists?

209
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,251
[old-timey music fades away]

210
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,089
[creepy, ornate music playing]

211
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,174
[clocks ticking]

212
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:18,803
-[Enid grimaces]
-I'm pretty sure it's dead.

213
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,930
See the tire treads across its tail?

214
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:24,058
Local artist scooped that fella up
right here on Route 22.

215
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:27,520
You're telling me someone
actually goes out and collects roadkill

216
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:28,938
and turns them into that?

217
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,898
Can't keep them on the shelves.

218
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:33,359
Got a whole section
dedicated to these beauties.

219
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,152
Squirrels, skunks, snakes,

220
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,612
and my personal fave…

221
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,158
family of ferrets at a clambake.

222
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,119
Too cute.

223
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,079
You two want to make yourself useful?

224
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:48,124
I reckon they could use
a good brush with a Tangle Teezer.

225
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,208
It freshens up the fur.

226
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,504
Maybe we can do that after, like, a…

227
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,005
An extended coffee break.

228
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,799
Right, Ajax?

229
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,388
Uh, yeah. We'll hit the Weathervane.
Want us to pick you up something?

230
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,058
No need to pay
for that overpriced hipster swill.

231
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,768
I'm brewing chaga.

232
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,229
It's my own blend.

233
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,356
Mushroom tea.

234
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,192
I foraged the little buggers myself.

235
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,820
Better get teasing. You're in for a treat.

236
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,326
Okay.

237
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,411
This is good.

238
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,787
-Delicious.
-You're welcome.

239
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:30,708
[in German] Enjoy your "authentic"
pilgrim fudge made with cacao beans

240
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,419
procured by the oppressed
indigenous people of the Amazon.

241
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:34,462
[tourist] What?

242
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:40,468
All proceeds go to uphold this pathetic
whitewashing of American history.

243
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:45,139
Also, fudge wasn't invented
for another 258 years.

244
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,850
Any takers?

245
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,769
[tourists] No, no, no.

246
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,145
[discontented murmuring]

247
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:02,948
Ugh.

248
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:07,870
[Eugene gasps]

249
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,790
Check out this greedy little freak.

250
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,250
Please, I need to get back to the…

251
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,044
[stomach rumbles queasily]

252
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:21,759
[bully] Whoa, yuck!

253
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:22,843
Yuck, man.

254
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,136
Come here!

255
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,472
[Eugene flinches]

256
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:27,640
[bully] Get in there!

257
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:29,934
Howdy, Pilgrims.

258
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,315
-Let him go.
-You want to end up in the stocks too?

259
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:39,318
Remember what happened
the last time we did this dance?

260
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,782
[tense music playing]

261
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:47,743
[bully 2] Get her!

262
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,038
[bones crack]

263
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:59,797
Are you two still here?

264
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,091
I can't get into more trouble with my dad.

265
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,426
[boy in stockade] No, wait!

266
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,136
Lucas.

267
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,306
Let's get you cleaned up.

268
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,725
[groans]

269
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,438
Principal Weems.

270
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:20,401
Well, it looks like another
successful Outreach Day is upon us.

271
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,610
[Weems chuckles]

272
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,362
And, uh…

273
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:27,658
thank you for your generous donation
to my re-election campaign.

274
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:33,247
[clicks tongue] Consider it a token
of our ongoing cooperation.

275
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,086
Apparently everyone
is off to their assignments.

276
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,838
And so far no incidents.

277
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:45,009
Mayor Walker,
I'd like you to meet Marilyn Thornhill.

278
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:49,513
In the spirit of outreach,
she's Nevermore's first normie teacher.

279
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:52,349
[chuckles] Well, the pleasure is all mine.

280
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,728
Hey, have we, uh… Have we met before?

281
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,898
Not officially,
but I see you in here every morning.

282
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:03,527
You're always tucked into that back booth
when I come for my daily matcha latte.

283
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:04,904
I knew it! [chuckles]

284
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,906
Miss Thornhill, please keep me posted,

285
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:10,618
especially about
a certain pig-tailed upstart.

286
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:12,745
Right.

287
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,419
Nobody's ever stood up for me before.

288
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,671
You said Hummers stick together.

289
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,341
I know this might come as a shock,

290
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,551
but I don't have any friends.

291
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:32,973
You remind me of my brother,

292
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,393
sans the desire to strangle him
every waking moment.

293
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:39,563
Now follow me.

294
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,107
I need to know more about this Crackstone.

295
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,984
We have a meeting house to break into.

296
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:46,737
[chickens clucking]

297
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,618
-Give me your retainer.
-What? Why? Your teeth are really good.

298
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,828
Not as straight or white as Enid's, but--

299
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:55,746
Hand it over!

300
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,500
What if Mistress Arlene catches us?

301
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,543
Hive code, deny everything.

302
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,253
That's not hive code!

303
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,838
What's the big deal anyway?

304
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,466
The fudge is definitely
the best thing about this place.

305
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,093
Stop talking. Keep watch.

306
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:13,013
[tense music playing]

307
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,855
[Wednesday] <i>My grandmother once told me</i>
<i>secrets are like zombies…</i>

308
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,109
<i>they never truly die.</i>

309
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,322
<i>I'm not sure what secret</i>
<i>Crackstone is hiding,</i>

310
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:34,410
<i>but I have a strange feeling</i>
<i>the answers to my future lie in the past.</i>

311
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,003
<i>The Old Meeting House, </i>1625.

312
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,474
Thing, this is the girl from my vision.

313
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,477
She's even holding the same book.

314
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,522
That black one she had
outside Crackstone's crypt.

315
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,149
[dramatic music playing]

316
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,573
How now.

317
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:14,116
Your Nevermore sister,

318
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,493
the one with the dark eyes
and the sour face,

319
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,745
where has she hithered?

320
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,496
You mean Wednesday Addams?

321
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:23,500
Knowing her,
she's hithered somewhere she shan't be.

322
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,177
This is the book!

323
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,768
<i>Codex Umbrarum.</i>

324
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,770
That's Latin for "Book of Shadows."

325
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,775
Great. It's a fake.

326
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:53,363
I don't know who Etsy is,
but I doubt she was an outcast settler.

327
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,657
-[door opens]
-[grunts]

328
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,327
Just what the fudge
are you doing in here, missy?

329
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,204
Mistress Arlene. How now?

330
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,747
How now, indeed.

331
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,374
I proclaimed the meeting house
is under repair.

332
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,376
I know thoust heard me.

333
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,087
I told her the door was unlocked

334
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,339
and you were dying
to learn more about Crackstone.

335
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,175
Yes, and this display case
was already open.

336
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,428
-That book's a replica.
-You don't say.

337
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,348
The original was stolen last month
during the two o'clock witch trial.

338
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,309
It was probably
the only authentic thing you have in here,

339
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:24,311
yet you still charge $29.95 a ticket?

340
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:25,771
Hold thy tongue.

341
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,440
I'm reassigning you both.

342
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,317
To fudge-churning duty.

343
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,276
[disappointed sigh]

344
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,863
The original meeting house,
the one in that painting, where is it?

345
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,157
[sighs]

346
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,826
How the hell should I know?

347
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,328
I only moved here
from Scottsdale in April.

348
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:43,413
[quizzical music playing]

349
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:53,507
Can I help you?

350
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,394
[door opens, bell chimes]

351
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,814
Ooh. That gives me the heebie-jeebies.

352
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:10,858
[Ajax] I don't know.

353
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,278
You think squirrels and rats
could ever work out?

354
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:17,531
I mean,
they're two totally different species.

355
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:19,867
Oh, yeah.

356
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:20,909
I mean, totally.

357
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:22,703
Why not?

358
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,788
They have more in common than you think.

359
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:28,167
Most people are scared of them,
so it would just be us… them…

360
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,376
against the world.

361
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,753
Wow. [chuckles]

362
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,422
That was… deep.

363
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,884
You know, by the way,

364
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:40,304
I totally dug the way you scratched out
the bottom of our boat at Poe Cup.

365
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:41,638
It was pretty badass.

366
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:44,725
Thanks. You're not mad you lost?

367
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,019
I was just doing a solid for Xavier.

368
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,646
I mean, he's my boy,
but he's super competitive.

369
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,356
Seems so laid-back.

370
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,193
Bro's got a darker side
most people don't see.

371
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,654
I think it's because his dad is…
well, you know, famous.

372
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,823
All that pressure.

373
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:04,536
You realize this is, like,
the longest conversation we've ever had?

374
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,622
[heart-warming music playing]

375
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,917
Gorgons are taught not to engage.

376
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,879
You know, I don't want
to accidentally stone someone.

377
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,218
I'm not afraid of being stoned by you.

378
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,844
It's just temporary.

379
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:22,846
Really?

380
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:25,557
You mean that?

381
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,683
One hundo!

382
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,313
So, um, I was thinking of sneaking
behind the greenhouse tonight.

383
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,273
Supposed to be a blue moon.

384
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:36,235
Only happens once every 23 years
or something crazy.

385
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,904
Should get a killer view from there.

386
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,365
Cool. Hey, have fun.

387
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,619
You know that's where
a lot of kids go to hook up, right?

388
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,621
-I mean, it could get awkward.
-Ajax!

389
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:51,500
I just spent all morning flirting
and hinting and trying to act cute

390
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,419
while brushing some roadkill
just so you would ask me on a date.

391
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,339
Oh! [laughs]

392
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,383
Oh! That's what you were doing.

393
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:03,595
I kind of wondered when you spent
so long brushing that opossum's tail.

394
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,763
[both chuckle]

395
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:09,851
Hey, so you want to meet up
behind the greenhouse tonight?

396
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:10,769
Yes.

397
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:12,896
Yes, I do.

398
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:17,985
[proprietor] Ajax, can you help me move
the badger dentist to the front window?

399
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,696
Yes! I can't believe he asked.

400
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,948
[plucky, excited music playing]

401
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:31,206
I thought you were
supposed to be at Pilgrim World.

402
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,625
I deserted it
while my sanity was still intact.

403
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:34,626
Oh yeah?

404
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:36,837
You want a coffee?

405
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,715
It's one of the many perks
of this wonderful assignment.

406
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:40,924
I'm actually here for Tyler.

407
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,553
I told you he was bad news.

408
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,637
Twice.

409
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,181
But who I speak to is my business.

410
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:50,976
[bell dings]

411
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,730
You rang?

412
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,565
[scoffs]

413
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:00,819
Want the usual?

414
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:01,862
And some help.

415
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:06,575
You know the original pilgrim
meeting house, the one from the 1600s?

416
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,702
You know if it's still around?

417
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:12,205
What's left is out in Cobham Woods,
but it's pretty much a ruin.

418
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:13,790
Show me.

419
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,209
Uh…

420
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:19,046
There, but, look, it's kind of sketchy.

421
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,299
Squatters and meth heads
use that place as a crash pad.

422
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:24,676
My dad has it cleared out
every couple weeks.

423
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,761
What's this about?

424
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,346
Nothing.

425
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:31,767
You're becoming obsessed
with this monster in the woods thing.

426
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:35,437
Would you rather I develop
an obsession with horses and boy bands?

427
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,563
Thank you for the help.

428
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:41,777
Hey, listen, the ruins
are kind of tricky to find.

429
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,321
I could take you this afternoon.
My shift ends at 2:00.

430
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:46,531
Principal Weems would hang,
draw and quarter me

431
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,450
if I miss the big statue dedication.

432
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,870
And as enticing as that sounds,
I'd prefer to keep a low profile.

433
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:54,498
Besides, I know my way
around the great outdoors.

434
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,500
Don't tell me you were a Girl Scout.

435
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,835
I could eat Girl Scouts for breakfast.

436
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,213
I have an uncle
who went to prison for that.

437
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:03,048
[whimsically morbid music playing]

438

[birds cawing]

439
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,746
I was expecting more too.

440
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,793
Who you talking to, little girl?

441
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,880
Use "little" and "girl"
to address me again

442
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,882
and I can't guarantee your safety.

443
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,926
This is my place. Get out!

444
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,219
Thing, a hand here?

445
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:55,642

446
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:57,185
Hey!

449
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,068
Hey!

450
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:07,696
[grunting] Get off! Get off me!

451
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:15,454
There's nothing here.

452
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:19,040
[tapping]

453
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,084
No, I can't just touch something.

454
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:24,004
My visions seem to happen spontaneously.

455
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:29,426
I would rather dye my hair pink
than ask my mother for advice.

456
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,680
Oh, you want me to prove it to you?

457
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:35,849
No.

458
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:40,562
Nothing.

459
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,565
Ah, I bet this will give us
some real insight.

460
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:52,324
My visions are about
as predictable as shark attacks.

461

Burn her!

[villagers] Burn her!

00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:08,882
Burn her!

Repent!

473

Begone!

-Witch!
-Stand aside!

00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,030
Goody Addams!

476
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:36,576
You have been judged
before God and found guilty.

477
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,204
You are a witch,

478
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,539
a sorceress,

479
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:43,708
Lucifer's mistress herself.

480
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:46,253
For your sins,

481
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,505
you will burn this night,

482
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:51,716
and suffer the flames of eternal hellfire.

483
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,093
I am innocent.

484
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,971
It is you, Joseph Crackstone,
that should be tried.

485
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:58,056
We were here before you,

486
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:01,226
living in harmony
with nature and the native folk.

487
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:03,061
But you have stolen our land.

488
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:07,232
You have slaughtered the innocent.
You have robbed us of our peaceful spirit.

489
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:11,653
You are the true monster. All of you!

[Goody Addams cries out]

And I will send you back!

No!

[villagers hollering, clamoring]

You are abominations in the Devil's grip!

I will not stop
till I have expunged this New World

499
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,727
of every outcast.

Mother.

[chains rattle]

There's no time, child.

511
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:33,068
Leave me. Save yourself.

[Goody Addams] I shan't leave without you.

00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,915
Run. Avenge us.

517
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:50,502
Find the others
and save our future. [coughs]

518

Please. My sweet lamb.

519
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:56,508
Run. Run as fast as you can.

520
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,385
You are our only hope.

524
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:35,672
He won't stop until he's killed us all!

525
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:37,966
He's here.

00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:41,177
[menacing gurgling]

527
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:43,263

529
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,602
Thing, I saw her!

530
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,187
The girl from my visions.

531
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:53,857
Her name is Goody Addams,

532
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,694
and I believe she's my ancestor
from 400 years ago.

533

[suspenseful music builds]

534
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,838

[dramatic music playing]

538
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,160
The monster's human.

539
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,996
[Xavier] What the hell are you doing?

540
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:53,458
-I was following the monster.
-You saw it?

541
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,294
It's here? Do you have
a death wish or something?

542
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,505
What are you doing here?

543
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:01,382
I overheard you say you were
checking out the old meeting house.

544
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,051
It's lucky I showed up when I did.

545
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,969
I did learn one thing.

546
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:06,971
The monster is human.

547
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:09,974
Its tracks turned from monster prints
to human ones.

548
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,185
Show me.

549
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:20,276
The rain washed them all away.

550
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,361
[Xavier scoffs]

551
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,780
I know what I saw.

552
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:26,115
-I'm trying to keep an open mind.
-How big of you.

553
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,909
I do think you might be right about Rowan.

554
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,787
-[suspicious music playing]
-Why the sudden change of heart?

555
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:35,083
I texted him again today. I said
maybe we could meet over spring break

556
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,293
and go snowboarding like we did last year.

557
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:41,506
This time he texted right back,
said he wouldn't be able to make it.

558
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,967
Only you never went
snowboarding last year.

559
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,804
Part of me wanted
to blame his recent weirdness.

560
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:50,390
I didn't want to think
something bad had happened.

561
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:52,934
The cover-up is
always worse than the crime.

562
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,727
Now I need you to be honest with me.

563
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,231
Why'd you come out to
the old meeting house in the first place?

564
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,150
I was trying to learn more
about Crackstone.

565
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,695
Figure out how he's connected to this.

566
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:07,323
Yeah, you were trying to use
your psychic abilities, right?

567
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,075
What makes you think I have any?

568
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,161
Lucky guess. When did they start?

569
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,664
About a year ago.

570
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:19,210
When they happen,
it feels like I'm touching live wire.

571
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,088
I usually enjoy that sensation.

572
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,758
Yeah, but you can't control it
and that freaks you out.

573
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:27,802
My dad's a psychic.

574
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,137
Vincent Thorpe.

575
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,890
My brother's his number one fan.

576
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,808
Watched his Vegas Special so many times

577
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,394
I'm surprised it's not
imprinted on his eyeballs.

578
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:39,522
So I've lived with
a self-described master.

579
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:42,859
The first thing he'll tell you
is that visions can't be trusted.

580
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,444
They only show one part of the picture.

581
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:47,739
I saw Joseph Crackstone in front of me
as clearly as I'm seeing you now.

582
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,658
He gathered all the outcasts
in the meeting house

583
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:51,993
and burned them alive.

584
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,703
Okay, he was a sadistic asshole.

585
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:57,040
It was 400 years ago.
It's got nothing to do with now.

586
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,333
But what if it does?

587
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:02,712
You saw Rowan's drawing.
Crackstone was standing in the quad.

588
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:05,965
You're creating a story in your head
and using visions to back it up.

589
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:09,218
-They're telling you what you want to see.
-Are you mansplaining my power?

590
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:12,847
All I'm saying is my dad, the expert,

591
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,808
would warn you that psychic ability
isn't rooted in logic.

592
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:17,977
It's triggered by emotions.

593
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,981
And let's be honest,
emotion isn't your strong suit.

594
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:27,153
I believe Rowan was right.

595
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:31,240
Something bad is going to happen,
and I need to stop it.

596

[Walker] Thank you.

608

It is my honor
to celebrate our town's history

609
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:29,549
and Jericho's noble forefather,
Joseph Crackstone.

610
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:33,845
Now, he believed that
with a happy heart and an open ear,

611
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:36,597
there was nothing
our town couldn't achieve.

612
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:42,937
So together as one, our community
and our friends at Nevermore Academy,

613
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:46,149
we've built a monument
to celebrate his memory.

614
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:51,696
Now, may the spirit of Joseph Crackstone
be memorialized for eternity.

You're a trouble magnet.

-Jericho.

Why does this town
even have an Outreach Day?

Don't you know
its real history with outcasts?

The actual story of Joseph Crackstone?

646
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,160
I do.

Where you see doom,

652
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:58,758
I see opportunity.

653
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:01,093
Maybe this is a chance
to rewrite the wrongs,

654
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:04,639
to start a new chapter
in the normie-outcast relations.

655
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:07,600
Nothing has changed
since Crackstone. They still hate us.

00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:24,403
[elegant instrumental cover
of "Nothing Else Matters" by Metallica]

695
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:48,260
<i>To paraphrase Agatha Christie,</i>

696
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:51,722
<i>one coincidence is just a coincidence,</i>

697
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:53,432
<i>two are a clue…</i>

698
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:54,475
[Ajax humming]

699
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:55,810
<i>…and three are proof.</i>

700
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:06,612
No!

701
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,039
[sighs]

702
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:29,135
<i>Rowan's drawing of me and Crackstone</i>
<i>happens sometime in the future.</i>

703
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:34,140
<i>Goody Addams' warnings</i>
<i>about Crackstone were in the past.</i>

704
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,269
<i>And the monster is here in the present.</i>

705
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:43,232
<i>Three coincidences</i>
<i>that I know are connected.</i>

706
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:35,493
<i>That monster could be anyone.</i>

707
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:46,712
<i>The sheriff thinks they only exist</i>
<i>behind the walls of this school.</i>

708
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:55,221
<i>The truth is,</i>
<i>there are monsters everywhere.</i>

709
00:41:57,139 --> 00:42:00,726
[muffled screaming]

710
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:07,566
<i>And sometimes the monsters we least</i>
<i>suspect are the most dangerous.</i>

711
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,609
[shrieks]

712
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:09,652
[metallic scraping]

713
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,237
[shrieks]

714
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,823
<i>They don't need teeth</i>
<i>and claws to terrify.</i>

715
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:19,578
<i>They hide in the shadows</i>
<i>until no one is looking.</i>

716
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:22,206
<i>And then they strike.</i>

717
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:30,673
<i>But I'm looking now.</i>

718
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:35,511
<i>And I won't stop until I find the truth.</i>

719
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:39,265
[instrumental music intensifies]

720
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,961
[chilling music builds]

721
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,631
[music fades]

722
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,717
[jauntily macabre outro music playing]
