00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,350
Love these warm, fuzzy memories
we're making, Dad.

344
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,062
[tires screech]

345
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,569
I have to get back to the woods<i>,</i>

346
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,989
but Weems has been watching me
like a vulture circling a carcass.

347
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,031
And you want me to cover

348
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,951
so that you can return to the scene
of a crime that didn't happen?

349
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,786
I have beekeeping club this afternoon.

350
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,413
I need you as decoy.

351
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,290
Sorry. Two strikes.

352
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,834
I'm busy and bees totally creep me out.

353
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,796
Why don't you ask Thing?
Wait, you can't because he's mad at you.

354
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,090
Why's he mad? He's the one who screwed up.

355
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:39,303
All I know is that we spent an hour giving
each other manis, and he really opened up.

356
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,055
He feels like
you don't respect him as a person.

357
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,765
Technically, he's only a hand.

358
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,059
Wednesday! He's your family.

359
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:49,104
And he would do anything for you.

360
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,523
Go apologize
and I'll reconsider helping you.

361
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,287
[pages rustling]

362
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:14,796
I snapped at you.
I'll check my tone in the future.

363
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,883
Now chop-chop,
before all our leads turn cold.

364
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,267
What is it that you want?
Hand cream? Nail buffer?

365
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,894
New cuticle scissors?

366
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:30,646
Consider it done.

367
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,733
[tapping]

368
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,403
[Wednesday sighs]

369
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,914
I know I'm stubborn,
single-minded and obsessive.

370
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:51,041
But those are all traits of great writers.

371
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,962
Yes. And serial killers.

372
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:56,672
What's your point?

373
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,425
I have nothing to get off my chest,

374
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,095
and I am not submitting
to your emotional blackmail.

375
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,681
[tapping]

376
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:09,601
Fine.

377
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:19,319
When Rowan showed me this,
it confirmed my greatest fear.

378
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:25,033
That I'm going to be responsible
for something terrible.

379
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,952
Not good terrible, like Ivan.

380
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:27,869
Bad terrible.

381
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,622
And I can't let that happen.

382
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,417
That's why I need to find out the truth.

383
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,507
Breathe a word of this to anyone
and I will end you.

384
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:47,931
[bees buzzing]

385
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:50,600
[Wednesday]
If Weems comes sniffing around,

386
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,520
keep your distance,
look grim, and don't say a word.

387
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:56,982
-Payback is going to be a bitch.
-I'd expect nothing less.

388
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,278
Blab and I will squeeze you
like a honeycomb.

389
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:03,280
Snitches get stung.

390
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:04,531
It's hive code.

391
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:07,034
Besides, I should be thanking you.

392
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,953
This is the most girls
I've ever had in the shed.

393
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:11,455
Other than bees.

394
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:12,873
Shocking.

395
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,752
I've always had a thing
for werewolf chicks.

396
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:20,005
The chance that Enid ever becomes
romantically interested in you

397
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,381
is less than 1%.

398
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,966
So I've still got a shot?

399
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:23,884
Yes!

400
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:36,021
In ancient times, honey was used to treat
wounds and in sacrificial burial rites.

401
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:38,440
Cleopatra was rumored to bathe in honey.

402
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,192
Gave her skin a luminous glow.

403
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,527
You ever taken a honey bath?

404
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:44,363
I just don't wanna get stung.

405
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:47,449
The key is to remain calm.

406
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,577
Bees detect fear,
but you don't need to worry.

407
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:54,581
Because I have a very big smoker,
and I handle it like a pro.

408
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,375
Would you like to see it?

409
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,168
[Enid sighs]

410
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,921
[low, mysterious music playing]

411
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,176
[grunt in distance]

412
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:08,261
[jolting stinger]

413
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:13,892
[Elvis barks]

414
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:22,067
Sorry. I didn't want Elvis
to pick up on your scent.

415
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,361
Thanks. How'd you throw them off?

416
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:25,737
Uh…

417
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,907
-[chuckles wryly]
-Coffee grounds?

418
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:31,743
Deer-hunting hack.

419
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,912
One of the perks
of being a part-time barista.

420
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:36,832
I assume your father didn't bring
the bloodhound to play fetch.

421
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,041
He doesn't tell me shit.

422
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,002
You must think
it's weird I'm stalking him.

423
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:44,297
No, I consistently stalk my parents.

424
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:49,386
Hey, wait, what really happened
the other night at the festival?

425
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,806
Look, I swear I won't say
anything to my dad.

426
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,018
I thought Rowan was in danger.

427
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,062
Turns out I was wrong.

428
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:02,441
Then he proceeded to use his telekinesis
to try and choke me to death.

429
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:05,569
Holy shit. Wh… Why would he do that?

430
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:09,948
No idea. That's when this monster
came out of the shadows and gutted him.

431
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,492
Whoa. Whoa.

432
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,035
So… So you really saw it?

433
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,873
And it didn't try to kill you?

434
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:21,501
It actually saved me from Rowan.
That's the part I'm trying to figure out.

435
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:24,463
I came here to find something
that can prove he was murdered

436
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,006
and that I haven't lost my mind.

437
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,090
Yet.

438
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:32,471
[ominous music playing]

439
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:36,725
These are Rowan's.

440
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,727
I knew it was a cover-up.

441
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:40,479
[eerie whooshing]

442
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:41,688
[Rowan] <i>What are you talking about?</i>

443
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:44,024
-So much of my…
-…my new desk, you psychopath!

444
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:44,983
[Xavier echoing]

445
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:47,027
-Speaking of that--
-You creep people out!

446
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,489
-You know--
-Unbelievable.

447
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:51,573
I did.

448
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:52,741
You're crazy!

449
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,494
[grunts]

450
00:24:58,413 --> 00:24:59,372
You okay?

451
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,089
[Wednesday] I keep seeing
that same purple book.

452
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:11,468
The cover was darker.

453
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:14,095
More like a day-old contusion.
Keep looking.

454
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:25,232
I don't usually find students in here
looking for actual books. [chuckles]

455
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,567
Most sneak in to make out.

456
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,903
I accidentally walked in
on two vampires fanging.

457
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:32,447
I can't unsee that.

458
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,033
Is there something I can help you find?

459
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,412
Have you seen this before?

460
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:42,207
It's a watermark
from a book I'm looking for.

461
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:46,336
I think it's the symbol
to an old student society. Um…

462
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:48,672
The Nightshades.

463
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:50,215
Like the deadly flower.

464
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:52,884
Color me intrigued.

465
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,387
I was told they disbanded years ago.

466
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:56,972
Any idea why?

467
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:58,682
Sorry.

468
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,565
I was very impressed
with your answers in class today.

469
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:09,192
My mother is
a carnivorous plant aficionado.

470
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,236
I assume I get my red thumb from her.

471
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,989
Are you and your mother close?

472
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:18,410
Like two inmates sentenced to life
on the same cell block.

473
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:22,747
I know it can't be easy…
showing up mid-semester.

474
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:26,793
I've been here a year and a half,
and I still feel like an outsider.

475
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:28,962
Because you're the only normie
on the staff?

476
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:31,631
Enid told me.

477
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:36,177
To tell you the truth,
I've never really fit in anywhere.

478
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:41,182
Too odd for the normies,
not odd enough for the outcasts.

479
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,560
I thought Nevermore would be different,

480
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:47,606
but there's still a handful of teachers
who will barely acknowledge me.

481
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:51,484
I act as if I don't care
if people dislike me.

482
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:54,904
Deep down…

483
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,533
I secretly enjoy it.

484
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,747
-Never lose that, Wednesday.
-Lose what?

485
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:07,959
[sighs] The ability
to not let others define you.

486
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:09,794
It's a gift.

487
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:12,464
Doesn't always feel that way.

488
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:16,926
The most interesting plants
grow in the shade.

489
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:20,013
[subdued, emotional music playing]

490
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:22,349
And if you ever need anyone to talk to,

491
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:24,851
the door to the conservatory
is always open.

492
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:31,024
[bell tolling]

493
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:52,671
That purple book has got to be
around here somewhere.

494
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:53,880
Start investigating.

495
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:57,425
[enigmatic, inquisitive music plays]

496
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,547
Rowan's full of surprises.

497
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,216
[two knocks at door]

498
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,511
[Xavier sighs]

499
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:44,139
[knocking continues]

500
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,978
You're not supposed to be up here.

501
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,646
Good to see you too.

502
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,482
How'd you get past the Housemaster?
Use your siren powers?

503
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:55,692
Not while wearing this.

504
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,778
Would it kill you
to not think the worst of me for once?

505
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:01,740
-[Xavier] What do you want, Bianca?
-To see how you're doing.

506
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:05,076
I'm sorry about Rowan.
I know you guys used to be close.

507
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,495
Since when did you
give a damn about Rowan?

508
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,290
You were the one afraid
he'd do something to Wednesday.

509
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:13,626
Isn't that why you've been following her
like an eager-eyed puppy?

510
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,336
Or is there something more?

511
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:21,050
Seriously, what do you see in her?

512
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:24,846
You have a thing for a tragic goth girls
with funeral-parlor fashion sense?

513
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:27,599
Maybe it's because
she hasn't tried to manipulate me.

514
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:30,143
I make one mistake,
and you can't forgive me.

515
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:32,187
She treats you like crap,
you can't get enough.

516
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,563
Why are you fixated on Wednesday?

517
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:36,065
Because she thinks
she's better than everyone else.

518
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:40,278
I can't wait
to crush Ophelia Hall tomorrow

519
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:42,781
and watch her werewolf roommate crumble.

520
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,617
It's gonna be
a Poe Cup finale to remember.

521
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,078
-I hate to think what you've got planned.
-My game's already started.

522
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:50,789
I like to win.

523
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:52,582
Is that so wrong?

524
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,960
And you wonder why I broke up with you.

525
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,713
You used to love my killer instinct.

526
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:04,969
We were good together, Xavier.

527
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:06,471
Were we?

528
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,973
Is that just how you wanted me to feel?

529
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,105
Trust me, Wednesday Addams
is not the girl of your dreams.

530
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,691
She's the stuff of your nightmares.

531

533
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:30,870
Where have you been?

534
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:33,039
I'm literally having
a heart attack right now.

535
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,958
-Yoko's in the infirmary!
-What happened?

536
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,043
Garlic bread incident at dinner.

537
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:39,963
She had a major allergic reaction.
She's out of the Poe Cup.

538
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:41,172
I don't have a co-pilot.

539
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,174
It wasn't an accident. Bianca's behind it.

540
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,176
-How do you know?
-Doesn't matter.

541
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,428
You and I are going to
take her down tomorrow.

542
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:50,515
Wait. You're joining the Black Cats?

543
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:53,268
You're willing to do that?

544
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:54,727
For me?

545
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:58,857
I want to humiliate Bianca so badly

546
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,359
that the bitter taste of defeat
burns in her throat.

547
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:05,405
Yeah, but mostly you're doing it
because we're friends, right?

548
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,284
Tell me how she keeps winning.

549
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,994
It's a real brain cramp.

550
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:14,581
The past two years, no other boat has
made it across and back without sinking.

551
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:15,999
Sounds like sabotage.

552
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:17,917
There are no rules in the Poe Cup,

553
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:21,045
and she is a siren,
which makes her master of the water.

554
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:25,258
Then we just need
to beat her at her own game.

555
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:40,189
-We're all set.
-Good. Thing's in position.

556
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:43,651
-Wanna tell me what you two were up to?
-And spoil the surprise?

557
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:47,196
Speaking of surprises,
your costume's in the tent.

558
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:48,865
Costume?

559
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,619
OMG, you look purr-fect!

560
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,829
Only thing, where are your whiskers?

561
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,124
Ask again,
and you'll be down to eight lives.

[Bianca] What do we have here?

565
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:28,404
The runt of the litter.

566
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,575
For the record, I don't believe
I'm better than everyone else.

567
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,827
Just that I'm better than you.

568
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:39,415
I want to welcome you all
to the Edgar Allan Poe Cup.

569
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:42,835
This is one of Nevermore's
proudest annual traditions,

570
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:46,255
dating back 125 years.

571
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,925
Each team must row across to Raven Island,

572
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:51,219
pull a flag from Crackstone's Crypt,

573
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,638
and hustle back
without sinking or being sunk.

574
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:57,016
First team to cross the finish line
with their flag

575
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,686
wins the cup
and bragging rights for a year,

as well as some special privileges.

Let's go. It's over here.

Stay here and make sure
Bianca can't sabotage our boat.

602

a couple of jokers.

-[rower 4] Come on.

OMG, Wednesday, we did it!

633
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:47,283
This is the greatest moment
of my entire life.

634
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:50,453
Admit it, you kinda got into
the whole school spirit thing.

635
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:57,043
You didn't tell me
it was a dark, vengeful spirit.

636
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:07,345
The first Poe Cup took place in 1897

637
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:12,016
as a way to not only honor
Nevermore's most famous alumni,

638
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:16,103
but to celebrate those values
that all outcasts share.

639
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:21,484
Community, perseverance,
and determination.

640
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:24,695
And we certainly saw those values
on display today.

641
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:28,366
Yeah!

642
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:30,659

[Weems] Congratulations to Ophelia Hall!

645
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,916
As a former resident,

646
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:41,754
I will be happy to see the cup
back on the mantle after all these years.

650
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:11,909
People keep randomly smiling at me,
it's unsettling.

651
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:13,411
It's called having your moment.

652
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:16,080
You took down Bianca Barclay.
Try to enjoy it.

if you wanna hang out later.

Oh, come on, it won't kill you.

655
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:24,922
I'll think about it.

656
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:29,593
Yes!

657
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,470
[Weems] It's good to see you fitting in.

658
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:33,681
Just like your mother.

My mother and I are two different
people/species/everything.

The last time
Ophelia Hall won the Poe Cup,

661
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,235
your mother captained the team.

662
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:49,989
I was her co-pilot.

663
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:54,577
Maybe you two
are more alike than you think.

664
00:40:58,789 --> 00:40:59,707
[Enid] I'm so excited.

665
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:03,377
[quietly] It was your job to help us win.
She's never lost. Never.
