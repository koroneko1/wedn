00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:58,889
[fireworks whistling]

173
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,727
-[screams]
-[snarls]

174
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,395
Then on Outreach Day,

175
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:07,315
you arrived just minutes
after the monster disappeared,

176
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:08,941
yet you say you didn't see it.

177
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,613
I didn't realize proximity was a crime.

178
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,406
Then there's your drawing obsession.

179
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,451
You have drawn the monster
dozens of times,

180
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,786
yet you've never seen it. Or so you claim.

181
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,290
You even drew where it lived.
Then when Eugene went to investigate,

182
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,127
<i>you tried to kill him</i>
<i>so he wouldn't spill your secret.</i>

183
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,546
You think I would hurt Eugene?

184
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,715
Let's not forget
your oh-so-convenient appearance

185
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,217
after Tyler had been attacked
at the Gates mansion.

186
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,513
If I am the monster,

187
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,183
then why haven't I killed you?

188
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,732
Because for some reason I cannot fathom
or indulge, you seem to like me.

189
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,361
What's to like?

190
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,989
[broody, chilling music playing]

191
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:02,578
[door closes]

192
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,247
[thud]

193
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:07,958
How long have you been lurking?

194
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:11,587
Long enough to feel
the tension between you two.

195
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,880
Yowza!

196
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:15,800
Seriously, you could cut it
with an executioner's axe.

197
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,551
[rapid scrabbling]

198
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:21,889
I'd recognize the patter
of those fingertips anywhere.

199
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:23,432
Hello, Thing.

200
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,517
[emphatic tap]

201
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,728
You can't still be mad
about the Kalamazoo job.

202
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:28,854
It wasn't my fault.

203
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:29,814
[Fester gurgles]

204
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:32,316
You said you could crack that safe
in 30 seconds.

205
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,610
Five minutes later, we were still there.

206
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,820
You're all thumbs.

207
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:36,904
[forcefully] Enough.

208
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:41,117
[cheeky music playing]

209
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:42,576
Let him go.

210
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,539
Show me the diary.

211
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,417
[wet squelch]

212
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,501
[electricity crackles]

213
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,213
[Fester] Here we are.

214
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:57,800
Iggy was Faulkner's right hand.

215
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,594
Trained a generation of Nightshades.

216
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,680
And behind Iggy Itt…

217
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:10,020
Do I have time for a snooze,
or can you crack this quickly?

218
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,106
[insulted, determined music playing]

219
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:13,649
[knuckles crack]

220
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,736
[dial clicking rapidly]

221
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:26,328
[safe clatters]

222
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,794
[Fester] This is turning into
a replay of Kalamazoo.

223
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,426
-[resounding click]
-[snap]

224
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,152
These are some sweet digs.

225
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,238
How'd you swing your own single?

226
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:04,116
My former roommate
couldn't handle my toxic personality.

227
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,201
[Fester] Mmm.

228
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:08,746
Here it is.

229
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,706
[suspenseful music playing]

230
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,083
Faulkner describes Hydes
as artists by nature,

231
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,085
but equally vindictive in temperament.

232
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:19,215
Born of mutation, the Hyde lays dormant
until unleashed by a traumatic event

233
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,009
or unlocked through
chemical inducement or hypnosis.

234
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,596
This causes the Hyde to develop
an immediate bond with its liberator,

235
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,681
who the creature now sees as its master.

236
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,268
It becomes the willing instrument
of whatever nefarious agenda

237
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,853
this new master might propose.

238
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:37,233
[Fester] Anyone willing
to unlock a Hyde is a next-level sicko.

239
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,237
That means I'm not looking
for one killer but two.

240
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,031
The monster and its master.

241
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,533
[knocking at door]

242
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:51,539
[relieved sigh]

243
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,374
I didn't mean to startle you.

244
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,128
I was just working on my novel.

245
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,843
Enid has requested to room with Yoko
for the rest of the school year.

246
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,345
She did?

247
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:07,847
When there's a falling out,

248
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,808
I like to get both girls' perspectives
on what happened.

249
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,019
You two seemed as thick as thieves.

250
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:17,648
Ultimately, thieves turn on each other.
I've seen it with my own eyes.

251
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:21,902
Deflect all you want, but you and I
both know that you care about Enid.

252
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,240
And you have to admit she managed
to bring out a spark of warmth in you.

253
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:29,076
Oh, don't worry. Just a tiny spark.

254
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:31,412
Barely perceptible to the average eye,

255
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,205
but… I noticed.

256
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,792
Part of the dorm experience is

257
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:40,129
making friends with people
that you wouldn't normally connect with.

258
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:44,341
And those friendships
often turn into lifelong bonds.

259
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,759
I would rather buy a rope.

260
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,263
Is it really so difficult for you
to admit that you made a friend,

261
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,932
and now that she's gone
you might actually miss her?

262
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,144
I'll survive alone.

263
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:56,604
I always have.

264
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:02,276
Well, if that's your decision,
I'll submit the forms to Principal Weems.

265
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,198
[door opens]

266
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:12,786
[exasperated sigh]

267
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:16,123
Uncle Fester?

268
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,416
[faint squeaking]

269
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:20,377
[deflated squeak]

270
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,256
[whimsically eerie music playing]

271
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,014
Uncle Fester?

272
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:33,515
[muffled giggle]

273
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,228
Hey! Being a solo lobo has its perks.

274
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,398
You get to live by your own rules,
do whatever you want.

275
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:44,026
Just look at me. [chortles]

276
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,737
[whimsically eerie music
continues, trails off]

277

[chilling music playing]

278
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,992
Hi. Um, I need to talk to you.

279
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,411
No, like… like, right now.

280
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:56,997
Yeah, I know where that is.

281
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,626
Okay, I can meet you there
in, like, 20 minutes.

282
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,294
Okay. Bye.

283
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,504
Who're you talking to?

284
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:07,675
-It's none of your goddamn business.
-I know what you are, Xavier.

285
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,760
Can you stay the hell away from me?

286
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,606
Did you place the tracker?

287
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,944
Don't worry.
Uncle Fester's got you covered.

288
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:29,029
[lo-fi electronic beeping]

289
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:32,366
Okay. Let's hit the road.

290
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:37,579
What?

291
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,665
I picked it up on my way out of town.

292
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,918
You know me. I like to travel incognito.

293
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,462
[Fester chuckling]

294
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,716
[groovy, kooky music playing]

295
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:52,886
Come on, let's roll!

296
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:13,157
[music trails off]

297
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,039
[tense music playing]

298
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,007
[indistinct voice] Hey! What's so urgent?

299
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:31,717
What happened?

300
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,845
I had a dream where you died.

301
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,472
[scoffs] Get in the car.

302
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,776
[tower bell tolls]

303
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:53,155
Principal Weems, it is imperative
I speak with you about Dr. Kinbott.

304
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,699
Wednesday. We were just talking about you.

305
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,284
[Kinbott] Speak of the devil.

306
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,827
[foreboding music playing]

307
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,245
And she shall appear.

308
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,206
Dr. Kinbott was just
discussing your assessment.

309
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:05,375
I need to sign off on it
before she hands it in to the court.

310
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,420
Well, what's the verdict, Doctor?
Am I cured?

311
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:13,175
I'm glad you find it amusing.
The judge assigned to your case won't.

312
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,177
I've explained to Dr. Kinbott

313
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,180
that you've recently been taking
small but meaningful steps

314
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,641
towards embracing
your new Nevermore family.

315
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:22,684
Yes.

316
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:26,146
I think I've actually reached
the half-hug stage.

317
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,066
I've been reading about hypnotherapy.

318
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,860
It might be a good technique
to unlock my inner Wednesday.

319
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,403
Are you a devotee?

320
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,823
Yes, very much so.

321
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,576
I applaud your new willingness
to delve deep into yourself.

322
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,120
I'm seeing you on Monday.

323
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,287
We can start then.

324
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,874
What did you so urgently
need to discuss, Wednesday?

325
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:48,710
It can wait.

326
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,796
Now if you'll excuse me,

327
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,215
I have some homework to finish.

328
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,428
[door closes]

329
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,726
Kinbott has to be Xavier's master.

330
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:05,644
[Fester] Hmm.

331
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:08,063
The Hyde lays dormant
until unleashed by a traumatic event

332
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,774
or unlocked through
chemical inducement or hypnosis.

333
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,276
Mmm!

334
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,862
[Fester slurping]

335
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,156
Are you listening?

336
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:21,201
She must've figured out he's a Hyde
and used hypnotherapy to unlock him.

337
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,328
That would explain their secret sessions.

338
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,707
I think the kid behind the counter
has clocked me.

339
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,127
Yeah. He's walking over.

340
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,212
I'm gonna put him
in a Romanian sleeper hold.

341
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,338
-Cover me.
-Relax.

342
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,882
He's not interested in you.

343
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,719
Uh, made you a quad. On the house.

344
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:42,097
Hey, thanks kid. [chuckles]

345
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,057
Need a refill on this puppy too.

346
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:46,643
-Uh--

[music builds, fades away]

524
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,282
[students chattering indistinctly]

525
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,078
Come with me.

526
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,873
I have information
about Mayor Walker's murder.

527
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,760
Printed these off my dad's computer.

528
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:11,137
Seems he was trying to track down someone.

529
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,432
Laurel Gates? Looks like
he started right after Outreach Day.

530
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:16,017
Must have recognized her there.

531
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,686
According to British police,
Laurel was presumed drowned,

532
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,355
but no body was ever recovered.

533
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:24,943
The Gates mansion was purchased
a year ago by a 90-year-old candy heiress.

534
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:28,738
She then mysteriously died and gave
all of her belongings to her caregiver,

535
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:30,740
Teresa L. Glau.

536
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:34,369
It's an anagram for Laurel Gates.

537
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,330
Laurel secretly buys her old house

538
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,791
and then comes back
to Jericho as someone else.

539
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:41,417
Why?

540
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:47,131
Revenge on all the people she blames
for her family's misfortunes. Your father.

541
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:48,925
The coroner.

542
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:50,093
My parents.

543
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,053
Most of all, Nevermore.

544
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:54,555
How does the monster fit into all of this?

545
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,850
The monster is a Hyde.
It's doing Laurel's bidding.

546
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:58,935
She controls it.

547
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:02,438
You know who Laurel is, don't you?

548
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,315
[disconcerting music playing]

549
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,655
Wednesday, we don't have
an appointment scheduled today.

550
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:12,824
I wanted to return something.

551
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:13,908
[Kinbott] Uh…

552
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,328
I found it in your old childhood room.

553
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,083
[music box playing delicate tune]

554
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,964
I know you're Laurel Gates, and you've
come back to Jericho to seek your revenge.

555
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,926
And so did Mayor Walker,
which is why you had to kill him.

556
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,887
Who better to slide in and out
of the hospital undetected

557
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:37,432
than a psychiatrist under the guise
of visiting another patient?

558
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,684
[low, distorted audio]

559
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:42,562
You're not actually accusing me
of murdering the mayor?

560
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:45,356
The roses you left
in Eugene's room were your mistake.

561
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,484
They're the same variety
I found near your childhood bed.

562
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:51,029
I honestly have no idea
what you're talking about.

563
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:54,198
There's only one reason an overqualified
psychiatrist like yourself

564
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:57,326
would settle in the inconsequential
backwater that is Jericho.

565
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:00,538
It allowed you to crawl through
the troubled, young minds of outcasts

566
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:03,916
until you found one that you can
manipulate to exact your revenge.

567
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,295
You know what?

568
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,339
I don't have time
to deal with your delusional fantasies.

569
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:11,799
I have a patient emergency.

570
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,593
Who? Xavier?

571
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,929
I know all about the secret sessions
you've been holding in your car.

572
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,516
I also found the cave where you've been
holding sessions to unlock his Hyde.

573
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,853
You are so out of line.

574
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:26,355
Do you know
how violently unpredictable a Hyde can be?

575
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:29,275
It was your plan to have Xavier committed
before he could turn on you too.

576
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:32,153
Wednesday, you need help.

577
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:33,863
More help than I can give you.

578
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:35,323
Who you calling? Xavier?

579
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,325
Judge Reynolds.

580
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:41,037
I'm going to recommend you stay
in a juvenile psychiatric facility.

581
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,540
Oh, please. You and I both know
I'd be running that place in a week.

582
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,462
Time's up, Laurel.

Principal Weems, it's Valerie Kinbott.

585
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:05,561
Wednesday Addams
just barged into my office.

586
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,356
I wasn't aware
that Wednesday had a session today.

587
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:11,400
She didn't, and her behavior
was completely irrational.

Dr. Kinbott's dead.

595
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,535
This ends now.

598

You know what?
You need to stay out of my space.

599
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,977
You need to take your own advice.

600
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,480
You left that in my room.

601
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:33,900
Actually, you left it in Thing.

602
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:36,986
How long have you been seeing Kinbott?

603
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:38,321
Have you…?

604
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:44,911
What am I saying? Of course you have.
You've been spying on me, right?

'Cause I'm the villain in your fantasy.

My father thinks that my mental health
is a PR problem that he needs to manage.

607

He wanted to keep
his troubled son out of the tabloids.

608

doing in your shed?

Or Eugene's glasses?

Whoa, whoa.

618
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,896

-You have the right to remain silent.
-What?

625
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:13,040
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in court.

626
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,875
You have the right to an attorney.

If you cannot afford an attorney
one will be appointed.

I needed a few more boundaries.

Because we work.

We shouldn't, but we do.

But I don't apologize for it.

654
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:29,283
Not anymore.

I missed him too.

658
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:47,468
I'm sorry about Xavier.

659
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:50,805
I'm not. He's a liar and a killer.

660

Besides… there's nothing quite like
the feeling of being proven right.

Except maybe someone to share it with.

[Tyler] We're closed.

667
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,005
Then you should lock your doors.

There's some real sick people out there.

669
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:35,433

what happened with Xavier.
