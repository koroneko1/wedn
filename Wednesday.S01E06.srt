00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,393
Yeah, I know.

353
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:36,813
I want a better one.

354
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,816
What were you doing in the mayor's SUV?

355
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,985
I saw him coming out of the Gates mansion.

356
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:45,113
The Gates mansion.
What the hell were you doing there?

357
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,073
House hunting.

358
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,370
I overheard the voicemail he left you.

359
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:52,913
I was intrigued.

360
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,291
Back when the mayor was sheriff,

361
00:22:56,375 --> 00:23:00,087
he used to have a lot of wild theories
on cases that he couldn't solve.

362
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:04,383
So… we'd dissect them over pie,
sitting right back there in that booth.

363
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,843
Most of the time they went nowhere.

364
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,303
Call me old-fashioned,

365
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,723
but when someone is run over on their way
to give the police key information,

366
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,850
it usually means they were onto something<i>.</i>

367
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:17,020
And all signs point
to the Gates family and that house.

368
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,188
The Gates family.

369
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,982
How? They're all dead.
Every last one of them.

370
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,527
-And I don't believe in ghosts.
-Maybe you should.

371
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,286
How do you end up at the center

372
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,622
of every terrible thing that happens here?

373
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:36,957
Incredible luck.

374
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,876
As of now, the school is on full lockdown,

375
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:43,672
and your off-campus privileges
are revoked until further notice.

376
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:50,929
[frenetic clacking]

377
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:59,062
Wednesday, I just heard
what happened to Mayor Walker.

378
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:02,566
Are you all right? I… I can't imagine
witnessing something like that.

379
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,401
-[typewriter dings]
-It was on my bucket list.

380
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,571
You can tell the warden
I'm still in my cell.

381
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:11,700
Principal Weems is
only looking out for your best interests.

382
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:15,078
You could have been
seriously hurt or worse.

383
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:21,001
Oh. How goes the novel?

384
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,421
Viper's investigation has been
thwarted on several fronts,

385
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:26,798
but she's plotting
her next course of action.

386
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,550
[keys clacking]

387
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,926
Sounds intriguing.

388
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,763
I saw this on my bookshelf
and thought of you.

389
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:38,226
Mary Shelley wrote it on a dare
when she was only 19.

390
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,311
I know.

391
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,397
She's both my literary hero and nemesis,

392
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,442
and I have two years
and 364 days to beat her.

393
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:50,155
Well, I think it's very smart
that you're focusing on literary monsters,

394
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:53,366
and leaving whatever real ones
might be out there to the authorities.

395
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,661
"No man chooses evil because it is evil."

396
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,372
"He only mistakes it for happiness,
the good he seeks."

397
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:02,375
Mary Shelley wrote that line
to describe people like Weems,

398
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:05,045
who do bad things under the guise
of protecting the greater good.

399
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:07,589
Did she put you up to this?

400
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,966
-[scoffs]
Encourage me to pursue other interests?

401
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:10,884
No.

402
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,471
But she will expel you
if you continue to defy her.

403
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:18,099
So you're only looking out
for my best interests?

404
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:19,643
Always.

405
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,103
-I think we're a lot alike.
-We aren't.

406
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:27,192
I don't need your help or your pity.
I already have a mother and a therapist.

407
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:29,069
That's enough torture, even for me.

408
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,114
[dejected sigh]

[phone ringing]

414
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,174
Hello?

415
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:55,136
-I've reconsidered your offer.
[Tyler] <i>My offer?</i>

416
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,471
The non-birthday dinner.

417
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,891
Really? That's great. Um…

418
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:02,602
When are you free?

419
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:05,021
<i>Pick me up outside</i>

Uh… Wednesday?

422
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:13,446
[Galpin] Ty? What did I tell you?

423
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,283
Come on, bud,
steer clear of Wednesday Addams.

424
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:18,451
She's the kind of girl
who's gonna get you hurt.

425
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,245
Believe me, I know the type.

426
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:23,164
Is that supposed to be about Mom?

427
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:28,044
Of course not. That would require you
to actually talk about her.

428
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,964
[low, discomforting music playing]

429
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,682
I can't deal with this right now.

430
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:44,019
I gotta get to the hospital.
I gotta check on the mayor.

431
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,520
Be home before curfew.

432
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,188
Did you ever even love her?

[poignant, melancholy music playing]

434
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,071
More than you could ever know.

[quizzical music playing]

437
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,961
I've been thinking about
my less-than-enthusiastic response

438
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,463
to your surprise soirée.

439
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:12,964
And I must admit,

440
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,842
I regret not showing my gratitude
towards you more appropriately.

441
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,764
-You really mean it?
-Take the win, Enid.

442
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:22,641
If only there were a way for us

to get off campus
and have a little birthday redo.

444
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:27,771
Just two best friends.

445
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,774
Too bad the school is on lockdown.

446
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,153
Would you look at that full moon…

447
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:42,285
Oh, how about I say I'm about to wolf out
and get a pass to the lupin cages?

448
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,287
And say you volunteered to lock me in.

449

has finally rubbed off on you.

Oh, I… I believe I left mine at fencing.

Actually, you left yours
at the Weathervane.

Luckily, Bianca brought it back.

-Okay. This isn't what I signed on for.
-Ditto.

You didn't have to trick us.

If you want to go, you can.

All right, you go left, I go right.

528

You seriously want to split up? In here?

529
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:19,515
That is literally how every best friend
dies in a horror movie.

530
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,060
The faster we search,
the sooner you can leave.

[voice trembling] Why am I even here?

00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,617
I know what my mom would say.

536
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,453
"Enid, you're a doormat."

537
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:43,331
"You're too needy."

538
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:47,585
"Show some teeth.
Nobody likes a desperate little furball."

539
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:49,337

543
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:11,859

Looks like somebody moved back
into their old room.

549
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,261
It's not possible.

550
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:41,430
She died 25 years ago, drowned overseas.

What are you doing?

579
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,215
These are the body parts
from the monster's victims.

580
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:40,132
Come on.

581
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,974

-You okay?
-Since when do you care?

583
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:58,192
Wednesday, what the hell are you thinking?

584
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,361
[Wednesday] We have to go back for Tyler!

585
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,363
[Enid] The monster's there!

586
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:03,698
[Tyler breathing heavily]

587
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:07,785
Enid, hold this.

588
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:10,329
-That thing is still inside!
-You're hurt. Can you walk?

589
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:13,708
[Wednesday] Where'd you come from?

590
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:15,376
Here.

591
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,377
Take this.

592
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,420
[Tyler grunting]

593
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,547
[Xavier] What happened to him?

594
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,305
[Tyler winces softly]

595
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:30,891
Thanks, Doc.

596
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:33,060
[Enid] Not to make this about me,

597
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,604
but I am having
a full-blown panic attack now.

598
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:38,941
We need to get back
before Weems realizes we've been gone.

599
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,862
What the hell happened?

600
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:46,574
-This was you, wasn't it?
-Wait, Dad, please. I'm okay.

601
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:50,244
Sheriff, I understand you're upset,
but I think you need to see something.

602
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,341
It was all here.

603
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:08,220
The… The… The body parts
and the blue Cadillac, the altar,

604
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,556
and the bedroom filled with fresh roses.

605
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,141
Yeah, well, it's all gone now.

606
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:14,435
Somebody cleared this place out
after we left.

607
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:19,148
Listen, yesterday I told you all signs
pointed to this house, and I was right.

608
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:23,778
That your justification for almost getting
my son and your friends killed? Huh?

609
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:26,989
Now, you listen to me.

610
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,826
From this point forward,
you are forbidden from seeing Tyler,

611
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:35,498
and you are forbidden from pursuing
anything to do with this case, understood?

612
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:44,131
[thunder rumbling]

613
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:53,557
You directly violated my explicit order
and left campus during a lockdown.

614
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:57,436
Not to mention putting your peers
and yourself in danger.

615
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:00,398
Which is grounds for expulsion. I know.

616
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,651
And you have every right
to exercise that option.

617
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:07,113
I do believe it would be
a grave error on your part.

618
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,197
[disbelieving scoff]

619
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:13,452
I think contrition might be in order
right now, Miss Addams. Not hubris.

620
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:16,163
I'll never apologize
for trying to uncover a truth.

621
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:19,333
[menacing music playing]

622
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:26,757
[Weems] What is this?

623
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,135
It's a warning from Rowan.

624
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,980
Is this why he tried to kill you?

625
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,774
His mother drew it before she died.

626
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,985
Said I was destined to destroy the school.

627
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:48,612
But I think I'm meant to save it.

628
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,365
Now you know what's at stake.

629
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,534
Everything you vowed to protect, no less.

630
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,078
I think I deserve another chance.

631
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,125
Please.

632
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:15,014
One more infraction…

633
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:20,311
One more step out of line
and you will be expelled.

634
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:22,521
No ifs, no buts.

635
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:26,609
-Enid and Xavier are spared as well.
-And no more negotiation.

636
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:28,110
Good night.

637
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:42,917
Where are you going?

638
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:43,959
Yoko's room.

639
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:47,213
Thornhill said I could
crash there for a few nights.

640
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,256
There's no need.

641
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,051
I spoke with Weems.
You and Xavier won't be punished.

642
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,511
Am I supposed to thank you?

643
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:56,639
I already apologized. It's over.

644
00:41:58,807 --> 00:41:59,808
Over?

645
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:04,730
Tonight was the icing on the birthday cake
you couldn't even be bothered to cut.

646
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:09,401
You'll use anyone to get what you want,
even if it means putting them in danger.

647
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:12,947
We could have died tonight
because of your stupid obsession.

648
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,281
But we didn't.

649
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:17,785
And now
I'm one step closer to solving this case.

650
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,328
That is what is important.

651
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:24,750
I've tried

652
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:25,668
really,

653
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:26,794
really,

654
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,796
really hard to be your friend.

655
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,382
Always put myself out there.

656
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:34,134
Thought of your feelings. Told people,

657
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:37,388
"I know she gives off serial killer vibes,
but she's just shy."

658
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:38,681
I never asked you to do that.

659
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:41,058
You didn't have to
because that's what friends do!

660
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,060
They don't have to be asked.

661
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:47,106
The fact that you don't know that
says everything.

662
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:51,527
You want to be alone, Wednesday? Be alone.
