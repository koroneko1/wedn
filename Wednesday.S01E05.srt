00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,765
[Wednesday] <i>How well</i>
<i>do we really know our parents?</i>

3
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:17,684
<i>Take my father.</i>

4
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:20,061
<i>I've always considered him an open book.</i>

5
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:24,232
<i>A man given to misguided schemes</i>
<i>and exaggerated displays of affection.</i>

6
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:26,693
<i>But when he was a student,</i>

7
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:29,487
<i>he was accused of a murder</i>
<i>that took place right up there.</i>

8
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:31,740
<i>Which leads me to wonder…</i>

9
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:35,493
[intense, unsettling music playing]

10
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:41,207
<i>…what really happened</i>
<i>that stormy night 32 years ago?</i>

11
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,342
[screams]

12
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,430
[music swells]

13
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:05,398
I think he had a sword,
and they certainly have issues.

14
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:09,069
I don't like to tell tales,
Sheriff Walker,

15
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,404
but it's all Morticia Frump's fault.

16
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,782
They were fighting over her.

17
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:20,997
Tish…

18
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,999
I don't know what to say, Gomez.

19
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,794
Seeing you in handcuffs,
accused of murder…

20
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:28,755
I've never loved you more.

21
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:29,964
<i>Cara mia.</i>

22
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,008
All right, that's enough, Addams.

23
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,093
Let's go.

24
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:39,557
-Let's move it out. Let's get going.

[quirkily dreary music playing]

27
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:13,424
Ah, the fetid air of teenage angst.

28
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:16,636
These were the best years of our lives,
were they not, Tish?

29
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,389
They certainly were, <i>mi cariño</i>.

30
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,435
I hope Wednesday's happy to see us.

31
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:28,565
I left a dozen messages
on her crystal ball. Still no reply.

32
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,276
Fret not, my plum-lipped cupid.

33
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:34,112
I'm sure she's dying to see us.

34
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,448
[Gomez] Mmm.

35
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:38,950
[Pugsley] Come on, let's go.

36
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:43,746
[bell tolls]

37
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:51,462
Nevermore was created
as a safe haven for our children

38
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,756
to learn and to grow,

39
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,259
no matter who or what they are.

40
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,927
[applause]

41
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,101
I realize most of you have heard about

42
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,563
the unfortunate incident
involving one of our students.

43
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:11,441
But I'm happy to report
that Eugene is on the mend

44
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,735
and is expected to make a full recovery.

45
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,987
So let's focus on the positive

46
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,574
and make this Parents' Weekend
our very best yet.

47
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:23,578
[Wednesday] On the mend?

48
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:25,747
Try in a coma.

49
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:27,582
Have you been to see him?

50
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,461
-You're his friend.
-I'm the reason he's in the hospital.

51
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,379
That is not your fault, okay?

52
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,925
The monster hasn't attacked anyone
in the past week.

53
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,676
Maybe you finally scared it off.

54
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,262
Or maybe it went into hiding
to avoid this weekend.

55
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,974
[Morticia] Look at this.
Some things never change.

56
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,518
[quirky music continuing]

57
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,479
I knew I should have worn my plague mask.

58
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,649
Would you look at my family?

59
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,193
-[howling]
-Talk about toxic pack mentality.

60
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:58,529
I give my mom 30 seconds
before her judge-y claws come out.

61
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,283
[Enid sighs] Let's get this over with.

62
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,122
There she is.

63
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:11,459
Oh, how we missed those
accusing eyes and youthful sneer.

64
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,922
How are you, my little rain cloud?

65
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,633
I thought Thing was filling you in
on my every move.

66
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,553
I uncovered your feeble subterfuge
almost immediately.

67
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,890
So, how's the little fella doing?

68
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,851
Does he still have all his fingers?

69
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,771
Relax. I haven't snapped
any of his digits.

70
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:32,772
Yet.

71
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,233
So tell us everything.

72
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,070
Since you've abandoned me here,
I've been hunted, haunted…

73
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,865
and the target of an attempted murder.

74
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:47,120
Ah, Nevermore. I love you so.

75
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:48,913
Enid.

76
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:52,500
Oh, let me look at you.

77
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:56,212
-One-one-thousand, two-one-thousand…
-Have you not been waxing?

78
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,340
Three seconds. That's a personal best.

79
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,175
[sniffing]

80
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,262
Are you feeling well?
You're looking a touch anemic.

81
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,472
Have you been eating enough red meat?

82
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,600
It's good to see you too, Mom.

83
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,019
And you, Dad.

84
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,774
[somber, inquisitive music playing]

85
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:21,154
Not sure how much more of this
family togetherness I can take.

86
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,867
Think you skipped where you apologize
for acting like a jerk last weekend.

87
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,953
I'm sorry for what happened at the dance.

88
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:32,248
I shouldn't have asked you
to siren-song me like that.

89
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,629
Guessing your dad's
a no-show again this year?

90
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:39,672
Yeah.

91
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,800
I got a text this morning. You?

92
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:46,763
Gabrielle hasn't shown her face
since I started here.

93
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,558
Probably sunning herself
somewhere in the Seychelles.

94
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:52,518
[woman] My darling daughter.

95
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,481
I made it.

96
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,150
Wouldn't miss this for the world.

97
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,070
I guess you misjudged her.

98
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,993
[music builds ominously, fades away]

99
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,328
[gasps softly]

100
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:12,789
Our old yearbook.

101
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:17,085
I haven't laid eyes on this
in over 20 years.

102
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:20,213
Such good times we had,
didn't we, Larissa?

103
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,840
Some of us better than others.

104
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,884
Oh, don't be so modest.

105
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:28,012
You always filled a room
with your presence.

106
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,224
Like a stately sequoia tree.

107
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,727
And I guess that would make you
the lumberjack.

108
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:40,400
[laughs] There's that biting
sense of humor that I always adored.

109
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:46,697
Do you remember when we did that duet
for the Solstice Talent Show?

110
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:50,910
Your Judy Garland impression
was a dead ringer.

111
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,038
Sounds positively suicidal.

112
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,290
Oh.

113
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,252
My picture's gone.

114
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,504
Really? Well, that is odd.

115
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,382
May I borrow this for the weekend?

116
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:08,511
That way Gomez and I can take
a little walk down memory lane.

117
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,679
Rawr.

118
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:10,805
[purrs playfully]

119
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:11,931
[Weems] All right.

120
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,809
Let's get down
to the matter at hand, shall we? Hmm?

121
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:21,858
Unfortunately, Wednesday's
assimilation has been rocky at best.

122
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,693
Because I refuse to embrace

123
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,904
the culture of dishonesty
and denial permeating this school.

124
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:30,324
Starting with the monster that
killed Rowan and put Eugene in the ICU.

125
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:34,120
Although I do hear he's on the mend.

126
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:37,165
We've always encouraged Wednesday
to speak her mind.

127
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:40,543
Sometimes her sharp tongue can cut deep.

128
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:44,255
Apparently her therapist feels
she hasn't been very open to the process.

129
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:47,300
Their time together has not yielded
the results we'd hoped.

130
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:48,301
I'm not a lab rat.

131
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:52,346
Dr. Kinbott and I have spoken,
and we both agree

132
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:57,268
it would be most beneficial for you all
to attend a family session this weekend.

133
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,269
No.

134
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,857
I thought that might be your reaction,
but your parents can see the wisdom in it.

135
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:07,737
Um, not to side with Wednesday,
but, um, we're only here for the weekend.

136
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,448
Oh, come on.

137
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,158
What can it hurt? To be honest,

138
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:15,578
I've always been a big fan
of head-shrinking.

139
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,414
It's not that kind of head-shrinking,
<i>mon chéri.</i>

140
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,541
Well,

141
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,044
that is disappointing.

142
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,004
But anything for our little girl.

143
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,088
Ah.

144
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,052
[quirkily dreary music playing]

145
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,431
Yeah.

146
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:39,018
You make sure they search that cave
for any sign of that creature.

147
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:42,855
No stone unturned.
They bag and tag everything, all right?

148
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,860
And then follow up with the lab.
I want the DNA results on that claw.

149
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,948
We already got one kid in the ICU,
a bunch of people in the morgue.

150
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,366
I don't want any more.

151
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:56,619
All right.

152
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,747
[foreboding music playing]

153
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,376
Son of a bitch.

154
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,087
What's wrong?

155
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,590
Just hard to stomach a murderer
wandering around town scot-free.

156
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:14,637
At least they care enough
about Wednesday to go to therapy with her.

157
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,181
Tyler, come on. We've been through this.

158
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,724
I'm just… I'm not comfortable

159
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,394
dredging up the family past
with some complete stranger.

160
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,230
Think it's easy for me to sit there
and talk about my crap?

161
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:27,316
-[phone ringing]
-I've got a lot on my plate now, bud.

162
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,197
You got the results already?

163
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,868
All right. Tape off the scene.
I'll be right there.

164
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,539
Dad. You okay? What's going on?

165
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:42,623
[sighs]

166
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,793
You know Reggie, the local coroner?

167
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,130
He just blew his brains out.

168
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:54,552
[ticking]

169
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,687
So, who wants to start?

170
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,235
Maybe we can discuss what it's like
having Wednesday away from home?

171
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,158
I mean, for me…

172
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:21,412
[hesitating] …it's been hard
not having Wednesday around.

173
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:25,708
I never thought I'd miss

I think it's high time
my parents faced the music.

184
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,158
It seems they've been lying to me.

186

Whoa.

190
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:14,674
Those charges were dropped.
Your father is an innocent man.

191

Local sheriff doesn't seem too convinced.

192
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,886

How could you ambush
your father like that? Wednesday.

209
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,772
How could I?
You insisted I go to this school.

210

Did you really think
I wouldn't find out your secret?

211
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:17,111
You don't know the full story.
Your father did nothing wrong.

212
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,320
I'll be the judge of that.

And by community, you mean cult?

219

We are a personal development movement

-Don't say that man's name to me.

That is no way to talk
about your stepfather.

231

You actually married him.

232
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:15,211
He wants you to come home,
so that we can be a real family.

are starting to ask questions.

241

Sooner or later they will see through you.

-Why didn't you call the police?
-We tried.

No one believed us.

Garrett's father, an outcast-hating bigot,

353
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:12,145
was furious that your mother
had accused his only son.

And that's when I saw him.

359
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,543
He had broken into the school.

360
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:38,213
His twisted love for your mother
had made him insane.

361

His eyes bore into me,
brimming with murderous intent.

I know they make you feel uncomfortable.

How many fathers hand their daughter
a fencing blade when she's five?

390
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:50,137
Your saber strokes
were an essay in perfection.

00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,055
Or teach her how to swim with sharks?

They found you as cold-blooded as I do.

The right way to flay a rattlesnake?

They really do taste like chicken
when prepared properly.

The point is, you taught me
how to be strong and independent.

How to navigate myself in a world
full of treachery and prejudice.

My father did not kill Garrett Gates.

Well, I have his signed confession,

409
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,948

the saber he used to do it.

Both of which I'm about to deliver
to the District Attorney.

Don't you find the timing convenient?

your prime suspect,

All I see is a guilty man
who's finally going to pay for his crime.

And cuffing him myself,
oh, that was the icing on the cake.

How are you failing to see that someone is

desperately trying
to derail my investigation?

419
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:20,727
I found the monster's cave,
and I gave you the DNA evidence.

420
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,395
Did you even bother to test it?

421
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:25,690
This may come as a shock,
but the world doesn't revolve around you.

Here. DNA results.

423

So you truly believe
this is all some coincidence?

Whoever hurt Eugene
also murdered the coroner.

Unfortunately, someone sabotaged
the security camera in the morgue,

These aren't just ordinary summer camps.

454

These are camps
for lycanthropy conversion.

Well, he's confessed,
so there won't be a trial.

469
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,423
After he's sentenced,
he'll be sent to a state penitentiary,

where he'll lose his mind
being separated from Mother.

Did you know they haven't spent
a night apart since they tied the knot?

So you're a Nightshade.

496
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,698
That didn't take long.

497
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,742
Actually, I rejected them.

498
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,869
Why? Because I was a member?

499
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,913
I'll never live up to your legacy here,

500
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:33,915
so why try?

501
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,502
I win the Poe Cup,

I join the fencing team, you captained it.

503
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:45,093
Why would you send me somewhere
I could only ever exist in your shadow?

504
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,346
It's not a competition, Wednesday.

505
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:50,640
Everything is a competition, Mother.

506
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:55,228
But mostly I rejected them
because they're a trivial social club.

507
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:57,063
We used to be so much more.

508
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:02,151
Our mission was to protect outcasts
from harm and bigotry.

509

In fact, the group was started by
an ancestor of your father's from Mexico.

Oh.

How ironic, since she was the one
who killed Joseph Crackstone.

515
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:29,512
The Nightshades were her secret,
but deadly, answer to his oppression.

I know why you've come here, Wednesday.

521
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,283
[swords clanging]

522
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:52,452
[Morticia] <i>By the time</i>
<i>I made it up the stairs,</i>

523
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:56,164
<i>I found your father fighting for his life.</i>
<i>It was terrifying.</i>

524
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:57,832
Garrett, no!

525
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,084
[grunts]

526
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,169
[panting]

527
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,672
[both grunting, struggling]

528
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,510
[Morticia] Garrett!

529
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,678
Garrett, stop!

530
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:11,888
Leave him alone!

531
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,481
I'll never forget the way he looked at me.

532
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,902
<i>He was even foaming at the mouth.</i>

533
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:31,950
It was like I was staring
into the eyes of a rabid beast.

534
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,827
[grandly menacing music playing]

535
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:37,538
[wet squelch]

536
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,503
[shuddering]

537
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:45,838
[blade rasps]

538
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,551
Oh, no.

539
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:57,058
-[thud]
-[Weems screams]

540
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,935
[Morticia] <i>It was only</i>
<i>when I heard the scream</i>

541
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,645
<i>that I realized what I'd done.</i>

542
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,148
<i>Your father was so…</i>

543
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,111
<i>calm and brave.</i>

544
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:11,030
[dramatic music swells]

545
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,540
Tish, you need to leave right now.

546
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:22,542
Go to your room and lock the door.

547
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,293
You were never here.

548
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:26,170
-[erratic panting]
-You understand me?

549
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:28,297
Morticia?

550
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,592
Put this back on the table.

551
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:33,803
-Go.
-Okay.

552
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:42,854
Your father took the blame
in order to protect me.

553
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:50,737
I was so grateful
when they cleared him of any wrongdoing.

554
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,196
But I knew,

555
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:56,200
someday this would come back to haunt us.

556
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,541
You said Garrett was foaming at the mouth.

557
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:05,334
His eyes didn't look human.

558
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:10,173
I've never seen someone
so blinded by rage.

559
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,133
Maybe it wasn't rage at all.

560
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:16,137
Foaming saliva,
dilated pupils, mental confusion.

561
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,681
What are those all textbook symptoms of?

562
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,185
[delicate, inquisitive music playing]

563
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:23,227
[Morticia gasps]

564
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:26,689
But how can that be?

565
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,525
There's only one way to find out.

566
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:37,408
[sighs dreamily] This reminds me of when
you got your first grave-digging kit.

567
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,827
You were so happy, you nearly smiled.

568
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,663
Are you sure you don't want to join?

569
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,792
Uh… mm… No, that's okay, darling.

570
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,460
I don't want to spoil your fun.

571
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,212
[scoffs, grunts]

572
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:52,673
[hollow thud]

573
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,550
[banging]

574
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,641
Moment of truth.

575
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,229
[inhaling fondly]

576
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:10,691
Hello, Garrett.

577
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:13,569
I was right.

578
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:17,323
[Santiago] Well, well,
what do we have here?

579
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:21,369
Guess there's gonna be
an Addams family reunion

580
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:22,453
in lockup tonight.

581
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:24,914
You're both under arrest.

582
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:30,545
[Galpin] Get comfortable.
You can post bail in the morning.

583
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:33,131
[Morticia and Gomez kissing passionately]

584
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,675
Not even the long arm of the law
could keep us apart.

585
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:37,844
At least we'll have
one last night together.

586
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:38,761
Yes.

587
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:41,764
I've seen jackals with more self-control
than you two.

588
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:46,018
Neither one of you are strong enough
to serve hard time.

589
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,646
And thanks to me, you won't have to.

590
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:51,649
I knew our little jailbird
would have an escape plan.

591
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:53,776
[tense music playing]

592
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,155
It's a souvenir from our outing.
I borrowed it from Garrett.

593
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,283
He died from nightshade poisoning.

594
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:03,703
The remarkable preservation of soft tissue
and blue tint confirms it.

595
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:09,250
-Which means Garrett was dying--
-Before you stabbed him.

596
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,626
[gasps]

597
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,713
You look even more ravishing
as an innocent woman.

598
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:14,630
Yes.

599
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:17,884
For once, could you two
get off of each other and focus.

600
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:19,635
[eerie whooshing]

601
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,305
Prove to me you're still worthy
to be called my son!

602
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,807
Kill all those outcasts!

603
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,518
Sneak into that dance
and spike the punch bowl.

604
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:28,436
[thunder crashes]

605
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:29,812
Addams!

606
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:33,566
[shattering reverberates]

607
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:35,568
[Morticia] <i>Wednesday.</i>

608
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:41,490
Did you have a vision?

609
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:43,868
What happened?

610
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,870
What did you see?

611
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,706
The night Garrett died,

612
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:52,126
he had a vial of nightshade poison
that broke in his pocket.

613
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,295
He wasn't just trying to kill father.

614
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:58,925
He was going to use the nightshade poison
to murder the entire school.

615
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:08,309
Thank you for seeing us
at such short notice, Mr. Mayor.

616
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:11,020
Yes, well, veiled threats
have that effect.

617
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:14,106
Garrett Gates wasn't killed
by a stab wound.

618
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,152
[Walker clears throat]

619
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:23,574
That blue sheen is a telltale sign
of nightshade poisoning.

620
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:26,244
But you already knew that, didn't you?

621
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,246
Because back when you were sheriff,

622
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,206
you were in charge and covered it up.

623
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,212
[inhales, exhales deeply]

624
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:41,634
Ansel Gates hated outcasts and Nevermore.

625
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:44,679
He claimed the land
the school was built on

626
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:47,348
was stolen from his family
over 200 years ago.

627
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:51,352
Garrett went there that night
to spike the punch

628
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:53,854
and kill all the kids at that dance.

629
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:58,567
Ansel confessed the whole thing to me
in a drunken stupor. It was his idea.

630
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:02,029
Why did you instruct Dr. Anwar
to falsify the autopsy report?

631
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,824
You knew the truth
about how he really died.

632
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:08,202
Listen, my job was to keep the peace.

633
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,495
If there had been a trial,

634
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:12,415
Jericho's and Nevermore's reputations
would have been trashed.

635
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:15,960
I think the only reputation you were
worried about ruining was your own.

636
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:19,255
I remember Garrett bragging to me

637
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:21,716
that his father
had the sheriff in his pocket.

638
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,178
One year later,
you get elected mayor. Hmm.

639
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,723
No doubt with the full support
of Ansel Gates.

640
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,017
I resent your implication.

641
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:34,895
What I resent is that
you could have prevented Garrett's death

642
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:39,608
if you had done your job when I lodged
my complaint about him stalking me.

643
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,110
But no.

644
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:46,365
Men like you have no idea
what it feels like not to be believed.

645
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,329
[sighs]

646
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,623
What do you want?

647
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:57,835
[quirky, intense music playing]

648
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:00,629
All charges dropped.

649
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,340
My father will be released immediately

650
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:05,509
with a full and unequivocal apology
from the sheriff's office.

651
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,097
[emphatically] Do we have a deal?

652
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,529
You were very impressive in there.

653
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:33,454
When did your visions begin?

654
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:37,833
A few months ago.

655
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,336
-Hmm.
-Before I left for Nevermore.

656
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:43,089
I'm sorry you didn't feel
you could tell me.

657
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,843
I know we've had our difficulties lately.

658
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:52,306
Navigating the treacherous shoals
of our mother-daughter relationship.

659
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,561
But I'm always here for you, Wednesday.

660
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,189
Always.

661
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,739
Sometimes when I touch
someone or something,

662
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,618
I get these very violent glimpses
from the past or future.

663
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,704
I don't know how to control it.

664
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:21,001
Our psychic ability resides
on the spectrum of who we are.

665
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,921
Given my disposition,

666
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:26,424
my visions tend to be positive.

667
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:27,842
That makes me a Dove.

668
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:32,471
And for someone like me?
Who sees the world through a darker lens?

669
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,306
You're a Raven.

670
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:38,352
Your visions are more potent,
more powerful.

671
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:42,565
But without the proper training,
they can lead to madness.

672
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,110
If I could help you, I would, Wednesday.

673
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:48,195
But we're not trained by the living.

674
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:53,909
Somebody from our bloodline reaches out
from beyond to help us when we're ready.

675
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,328
Goody has.

676
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:58,205
I've seen her before.

677
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,082
Be careful, Wednesday.

678
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:03,043
Goody was a witch of great strength,

679
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,963
but her vengeance pushed her too far,

680
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:08,132
and even she couldn't save herself.

681
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:18,476
Sorry about all this.

682
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,146
I don't hold grudges,

683
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:23,981
only blood debts.

684
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:29,153
So, your daughter and my son have become…

685
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:31,530
close.

686
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:35,159
I pity any boy
who gets caught in her viper's gaze,

687
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:36,577
but he must be a good egg.

688
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:40,164
She wouldn't tolerate anything less.

689
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,209
He has his mom to thank for that.

690
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:54,303
[Pugsley] Dad!

691
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,973
I missed you so much, Dad.
I missed you so much.

692
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:02,269
<i>Querida.</i>

693
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:04,688
[Morticia] <i>Mi amor.</i>

694
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,565
[Wednesday] Don't crowd me.

695
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:14,114
[curious music playing]

696
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,787
[bell tolls]

697
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:23,958
So, it's decided. Six weeks at Camp Howl.

698
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,544
-You'll need to pick which activity--
-No, I don't.

699
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:28,295
Because I'm not going.

700
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:30,798
Not this summer. Not ever.

701
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:34,260
If I'm meant to wolf out,
then I'm going to do it on my own timeline

702
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:35,344
and not yours.

703
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:40,933
I hope that one day,
you'll finally accept me for who I am.

704
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:46,438
[somber, emotional music playing]

705
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:53,696
I'm proud of you, kiddo.

706
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,448
You do you.

707
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:10,421
I'll come back and help you
under one condition.

708
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:12,756
Wait until the school year is over.

709
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:17,136
-How do I know you won't run away again?
-Because we both have too much to lose.

710
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,887
But after this,

711
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:22,558
you and MorningSong
are out of my life… forever.

712
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:31,483
[Wednesday] Don't push it.

713
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:38,991
Well, at least we can't say
Parents' Weekend wasn't a nail-biter.

714
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:41,535
I knew you didn't have what it takes
to be a murderer.

715
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:44,163
As much as that stings,

716
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:47,666
<i>gracias</i>, my little death trap.

717
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,126
Mwah.

718
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:57,635
As I leafed through
the pages of this yearbook,

719
00:43:57,718 --> 00:44:02,681
I was reminded
of all the wonderful times I had here.

720
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,266
But they were just that.

721
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:06,602
Mine.

722
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:10,397
You have your own path to blaze.

723
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:14,485
I don't want to be
a stranger in your life, darling.

724
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:18,072
If you need me for anything,

725
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,698
anything at all,

726
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:23,243
I'm only a crystal ball away.

727
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:26,163
Thank you, Mother.

728
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:28,582
[wry exhale]

729
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:36,757
[air kisses]

730
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:57,194
[dramatic, resolute music playing]

731
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:06,620
I knew it.

732
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:10,124
I did witness Rowan
getting murdered that night.

733
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,166
Excuse me?

734
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,460
When Rowan appeared the next morning,
it was you.

735
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:16,422
When you participated in the talent show,

736
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:18,424
not only did you impersonate Judy Garland,

737
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:19,758
you became her.

738
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:22,469
You're a shape-shifter.

739
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:27,516
[scoffs]

740
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:30,561
That's a fascinating theory.

741
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:34,148
I'm curious to find out
how Sheriff Galpin feels when I tell him.

742
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,233
[low, menacing music playing]

743
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,778
You won't tell a soul, Miss Addams.

744
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:41,989
And it wouldn't matter much if you did.

745
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:44,199
Rowan's father already knows
what happened,

746
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:47,453
and he fully supports my decision
not to involve the authorities.

747
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,538
Why would he agree to that?

748
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:52,916
Because Rowan was not in his right mind.

749
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,669
His telekinetic abilities
were driving him mad

750
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:58,005
and he attempted to murder you twice.

751
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:03,135
His tragic death allowed us
to rectify the situation

752
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:06,847
without casting the school
or Rowan in an unflattering light.

753
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:09,933
You and Mayor Walker are the same,
aren't you?

754
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:13,520
Burying bodies
to cover your dirty secrets.

755
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:17,900
I did what I needed to do to shield
this school from controversy

756
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:19,651
and protect its students from harm.

757
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,195
Tell that to Eugene.

758
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:25,115
How are you protecting him?

759
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:28,619
[students clamoring, yelling]

760
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:38,796
What on earth?

761
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:44,343
[darkly menacing music playing]

762
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:56,605
[jauntily macabre outro music playing]
