00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:08,633
[low, menacing music playing]

2
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,988
Thing gave me your note.

3
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:32,782
I was surprised you wanted to see me again

4
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,826
after you ran out the other night.

5
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,580
So, uh, is this a date?

6
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:39,956
It's a surprise.

7
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,125
[wry chuckle]

8
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:52,302
When I came to Nevermore,
romance was the last thing on my mind.

9
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,097
But when you kissed me,

10
00:00:57,098 --> 00:01:00,101
you opened my eyes
and suddenly it all made sense.

11
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,395
[confused scoff]

12
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,106
Xavier warned me about you,
but I didn't listen.

13
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,108
Ironic now, huh?

14
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,235
Ironic would've been
framing Xavier for murder

15
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,154
while the real Hyde
helped me put him away.

16
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,451
Wait… you don't think--

17
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,244
I don't think. I know.

18
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:21,372
Kinbott probably discovered your secret
during one of your sessions.

19
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,499
So she unlocked you.

20
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:23,792
Why'd you kill her?

21
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,878
I thought Hydes
were typically loyal to their masters.

22
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:28,379
Wednesday, this is nuts.

23
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:31,966
On Outreach Day, I told you
I was visiting the old meeting house.

24
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:32,926
[Hyde snarls]

25
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,511
Did Kinbott send you to spy on me?

26
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:36,513
At the Rave'N,

27
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,140
<i>you overheard Eugene and me</i>
<i>discussing your cave in the woods</i>

28
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,225
<i>and you warned Kinbott.</i>

29
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:42,602
Eugene probably saw her torching it.

30
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,231
Then she sent you to clean up her mess.

31
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:49,150
I have to hand it to you, Tyler.

32
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,986
Wounding yourself that night
at the Gates mansion,

33
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,781
that was a masterstroke of misdirection.

34
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:57,158
Okay, stop. Do you know
how insane you sound right now?

35
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,202
I'm not a monster.

36
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,995
A… And if you really thought that I was,

37
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,040
why would you risk bringing me
out to the woods to confront me alone?

38
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,667
Who said I was alone?

39
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:18,096
Okay, I don't know what kind of sick joke
you're playing, but I'm out of here.

40
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,013
Actually…

41
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,559
you're coming with us.

42
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,311
[disconcerting audio distortions]

43
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,274
[snaps]

44
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,698
[tense, unnerving music playing]

45
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:45,748
Welcome back.

46
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,376
Where the hell am I?

47
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,503
Somewhere no one can hear your screams.

48
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:51,754
What's with the chains?

49
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,381
Don't ask stupid questions.

50
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,926
Wednesday, this is crazy. I'm a normie.

51
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,428
That's only half true.

52
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,140
Do you recognize her?

53
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:05,393
Perhaps if I hadn't been so distracted
by my own mother hogging this photo,

54
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:07,395
I would have noticed yours sooner.

55
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,899
Your father fell in love
and married an outcast.

56
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,820
[Tyler] My mom was an outcast.
That doesn't make me a monster.

57
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,739
According to her
personal medical records--

58
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:20,617
-You stole her medical records?
-Technically, Thing did.

59
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,912
He took them from your garage.
Your father's quite the pack rat.

60
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,582
Her postpartum depression
triggered her condition.

61
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:29,542
My mom had severe bipolar disorder.

62
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,002
We both know that's a lie.

63
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,045
She was a Hyde.

64
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,797
And your father has been
living his life in dread,

65
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,675
never quite sure whether or not
she passed her condition on to you.

66
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,804
Are you all gonna stand there
and let her do this to me?

67
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,140
Uh, guys? Enid just texted.

68
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,808
Thornhill's suspicious.

69
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,561
How long until he morphs into that… thing?

70
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:49,812
I'm not the monster.

71
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,440
You are. I saw it
in a vision at the Weathervane.

72
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:56,819
Wait, you're basing all this off
some vision you had after we kissed?

73
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,738
I mean, is that something you can trust?

74
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:00,949
[Bianca] Wednesday, what are you doing?

75
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:04,535
Just some light torture.
Don't worry, I won't leave a mark.

76
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:07,872
-[Bianca] Wednesday, hold on.
-[Ajax] Wait. Are you being serious?

77
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,625
There's only one thing
that a Hyde understands.

78
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,252
Pain.

79
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,878
-Wait! No, Wednesday!
-Wednesday!

80
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,381
That's it. I'm out!

81
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,050
-[Nightshade member] Us too.
-No.

82
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,134
-Wait.
-No, I'm done.

83
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,513
Wednesday, I didn't sign up for this.

84
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,557
-Let's go to Weems, explain everything.
-Weems won't help.

85
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,060
And Tyler is always
one step ahead of his father.

86
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,313
Then you're on your own.

87
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,315
[Tyler panting]

88
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,193
No, don't leave me here with her, please!
I'm begging you, please!

96
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,115
<i>I believe the trauma of losing his mother</i>

97

00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:23,383
We have a problem.

101
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,053
And her name is Wednesday Addams.

102
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:30,306
What is Kinbott, or should I say
Laurel Gates, using you for?

103
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,849
[weakly] Wednesday, please.

104
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,936
Tyler, the body parts
in the basement of the Gates mansion,

105
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,437
what was she collecting them for?

106
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,564
I don't understand.
Why are you doing this?

107
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,695
[sirens wailing, approaching]

108
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,281
Let's test your reflexes.

-[Tyler] I'm in here!
-Get away from my son! Drop it.

110
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:51,953
Drop it.

[indistinct police radio chatter]

114
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,929
Sheriff Galpin isn't
pressing kidnapping charges.

115
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,390
Which is a miracle
given the circumstances.

116
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:13,349
Of course not.

117
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,560
How long have you known?

118
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,353
Excuse me?

119
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,606
When I gave you that claw from the cave,
did you already know?

120
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,358
Wednesday, that's enough.

121
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,569
[Galpin] Xavier Thorpe is our Hyde.

We've got evidence, thanks to you.
That's why I'm giving you one pass.

Tyler is going to turn on you too.

124
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:30,450
Let's go.

125
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:39,208
Get out.

We… Wednesday, wait.

Tyler! No, no, what are you doing?

128
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,134
I need to talk to her, Dad.

129
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,470
She was my friend.

130
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,139
We're in a police station.
What's gonna happen?

131
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:00,813
Make it quick.

132
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,155
What do you want?

133
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,033
To ask a question.

134
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,996
What does it feel like?

135
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,582
What does what feel like?

136
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,251
To lose.

137
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,338
[chilling music playing]

138
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,299
You know, at first,

139
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:29,800
I'd wake up naked,

140
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,636
covered in blood,

141
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,222
no idea what happened.

142
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,099
But over time,

143
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,685
I started to remember

144
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:41,562
everything.

145
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:45,274
The sound of their screams,

146
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,152
the panic in their eyes,

147
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:52,823
and a fear so primal I could taste it.

148
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,288
And it was delicious.

149
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,920
You have no idea what's coming.

150
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,139
[music swells, fades away]

151
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:33,114
[barely restrained seething]

152
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,997
The quid pro quo
for Sheriff Galpin not pressing charges

153
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,583
is your immediate expulsion
from Nevermore.

154
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,294
The others had nothing to do with this.

155
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,087
I acted alone.

156
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:52,466
For someone who claims to have no friends,
you certainly protect them.

157
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,552
They didn't have guts
to do what needed to be done.

158
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:57,555
You mean kidnapping and torture?
I should hope not.

159
00:09:57,638 --> 00:10:00,850
You do realize that Tyler
brutally disemboweled six people,

160
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,977
then harvested a variety
of their body parts.

161
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,187
Perhaps if you'd come to me
with your suspicions

162
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,106
rather than take matters
into your own hands,

163
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,566
we could've worked together.

164
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:12,194
Because trust and cooperation have always
been hallmarks of our relationship.

165
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,821
[weary chuckle]

166
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,781
[gloomy music playing]

167
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,451
I admire your ability
to be your own person

168
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,328
and trust your own instincts.

169
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,539
But that also makes you
impatient and impulsive.

170
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,792
Your actions have put me
and the school in an impossible position.

171
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,294
Tyler is the Hyde.

172
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,465
And he has framed Xavier.
He confessed everything to me!

173
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,800
I wish I could believe you.

174
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,805
His mother was an outcast.

175
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,308
She was a student here,
you must remember her.

176
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,643
She was a Hyde!

177
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,519
Yes, Francois. A lovely woman.

178
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,438
I didn't ask what she identified as.

179
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:50,441
Then give me more time,
and I can prove they are Hydes.

180
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:51,776
There is no more time,

181
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,986
and there are no more deals, Wednesday.

182
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,697
Pack your steamer trunks.

183
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,199
We will have them shipped.

184
00:10:58,282 --> 00:10:59,742
And say your goodbyes.

185
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,037
You'll be on the afternoon train tomorrow.

186
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:07,875
I'm sorry Nevermore
didn't work out for you, Wednesday.

187
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,545
I'm sure your mother
will be very disappointed.

188
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,176

I know you're not the Hyde.

195
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,657
Tyler used me to frame you.
He is the actual Hyde.

196
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,411
How do you know?

197
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,164
I saw it in a vision when he kissed me.

[suspenseful music playing]

199
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:53,421
I'm… glad you were getting some action
while I was falsely accused.

200
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,131
I should've believed you.

201
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,883
But since you seem to have
some psychic connection to the Hyde,

202
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,844
I was curious if you've drawn anything

You're toxic.

was coming. I think--

I don't care!

That can't happen if you're not here.

I always believed relying on other people
to be a sign of weakness.

That inevitably they would
lead me to disappointment.

I've learned so much from you.

Part of it is admittedly
criminal behavior,

245
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:35,958
but… most people spend their entire lives
pretending to give zero effs,

246
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,419
and you literally
never had an eff to give.

00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,016
Just like you, Wednesday.

352
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:29,561
Once again,
you've underestimated the situation.

353
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,939
You were never getting on that train.

354
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:34,024
I sent Tyler to intercept you.

355
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,568
I never made it to the station.

356
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,445
Heard enough?

357
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:42,574
[dramatic, revelatory music playing]

358
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,955
Your slave is probably
still at the station.

359
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,625
Don't make this more difficult
than it already is, Marilyn.

360
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,586
My name is Laurel!

[Weems gasping]

365
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:09,184
[Wednesday] Principal Weems!
Principal Weems!

366
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,108
[Weems shuddering]

367
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,734
[Weems exhales softly]

368
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:23,282
Nightshade poisoning.

369
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,992
[Laurel] A fitting end, don't you think?

370
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,035
[clang]

371
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,707

[claws rasp]

375
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:49,516
Whoa.

376
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:51,935
Are you okay?

377
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:55,188
You're not gonna, like,
wolf out on me, are you?

378
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,107
It is a full blood moon.

379
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:59,401
I'm okay, I think.

380
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,904
But this is helping.

381
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,910
["Flight of the Bumblebee"

382
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,163

383
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,584
[phone chimes]

384
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:18,170
Hey! Eugene, how are you?

385
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:19,421
<i>Have you seen Wednesday?</i>

386
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,632
No, she left this afternoon.
Didn't she swing by to see you?

387
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:25,761
Listen, Principal Weems and her
went and confronted Ms. Thornhill.

388
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,804
But I haven't heard a peep
from either of them.

389
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,598
Why would they confront Ms. Thornhill?

390
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,850
<i>Because she's behind</i>
<i>everything that's happened.</i>

391
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,894
<i>She's the bad guy… bad woman.</i>

392
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,395
<i>She's just a really bad person.</i>

393
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:38,190
Okay. Ajax and I will go
check out the conservatory.

394
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:42,694

What's he doing in your room?

-Um…
-[door opens]

396
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:46,865
Wha…?

397
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,950
[rousing music playing]

398
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,579
Slow down! What happened?

399
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,834
Principal Weems?

400
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,212
-What the hell is going on?
-What about Wednesday?

401
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,297
Tyler and Thornhill took her?

402
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,257
Where?

403
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,426
Crackstone's crypt, what the heck?

404
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:10,222
Who are the Nightshades?

405
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:14,935
I'll… I'll explain on the way.

406
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,062
Come on.

407
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:19,481
<i>Guys. Guys?</i>

408
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:21,983
Calm down, Eugene.

409
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,111
That gorgon is a moron.

410
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,655
It… It could be dangerous.

411
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:29,199
If Enid's right,
and Wednesday's been taken,

412
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:31,701
-we need to call the sheriff.
-Mom, I've got to go.

413
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:35,455
Wednesday's my only friend,
and if she's in trouble, I've got to help.

414
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,623
It's hive code.

415
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,919

[Wednesday seething]

419
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:19,207
Kind of a déjà vu thing
we got going on, huh?

420
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,627
Except I won't cry and whine like a child.

421
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:25,297
[Laurel] Tyler, go wait by the boat.

422
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:26,923
Yes.

423
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:30,010
Listen to your master
and be a good little Hyde.

424
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,389
[jittery, creepy music playing]

425
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,269
-[Laurel] I have to admit…
-[door opens]

426
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:42,272
…that shape-shifting stunt
with Weems almost worked.

427
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:43,190
[door closes]

428
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:45,192
But as my father always said,

429
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:48,945
"If you want to outsmart an outcast,
you got to out-think 'em."

430
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:54,701
You know, we have roots that go
all the way back to Joseph Crackstone.

431
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,037
So you come from a line
of psychotic killers too.

432
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,123
Joseph Crackstone was a visionary,

433
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,792
dedicated to protecting
normies from outcasts

434
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,669
until his life was cut short

435
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,380
by your ancestor, Goody Addams.

436
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:10,008
And then, to add insult to injury,

437
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:13,178
they stole his land to build
that abomination of a school.

438
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:20,060
But,

439
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,021
throughout the centuries,

440
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:26,816
my family has remained
committed to Crackstone's mission.

441
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,486
My brother died serving that cause.

442
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:32,364
I decided to take a different approach.

443
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:33,990
The supernatural.

444
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:38,370
Tyler's been collecting these body parts
to resurrect Crackstone.

445
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:42,624
The one man who nearly succeeded
in eradicating the outcasts.

446
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,043
You can't wake the dead.

447
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:46,670
Believe me, I've tried.

448
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:51,341
I believe your ancestor Goody Addams
would disagree.

449
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,176
Goody's Book of Shadows.

450
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,929
You're the one that stole
the original from Pilgrim World.

451
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,558
It wasn't enough for Goody
to kill Crackstone.

452
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,726
She had to curse his soul too.

453
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,938
What does this have to do with me?

454
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,399
My dear Wednesday,

455
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:09,776
you are the key.

456
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:13,488
Your arrival at Nevermore set
the chubby wheels of my plan in motion.

457
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:18,076
Goody sealed Crackstone
in his sarcophagus with a blood lock.

458
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,079
Only one of her direct descendants
can open it.

459
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,039
You are the key.

460
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:26,293
A living descendant
on the night of a blood moon.

461
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:30,130
So… I bided my time,

462
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:32,215
and I made you feel special

463
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,843
until you were ready to be sacrificed.

464
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:37,220
[music swells]

465
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,514
[grunting] Damn it.

466
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:40,473
[Galpin] Quiet!

467
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,059
Santiago, what's up?

468
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,728
Sir, we got a situation.

469
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:47,314
Eugene Ottinger's mom
just called, frantic.

470
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:51,067
-Something's going on at Nevermore.
-Get a couple cars over there ASAP.

471
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,819
<i>That's just it, I can't.</i>

472
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:56,031
The tires on the squad cars
have been slashed. Every damn one.

473
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,116
All right, I'm on my way.

474
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,826

[Laurel] I am of your blood.

492
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:09,247
I have summoned you to rid the world
of outcasts once and for all.

[Laurel gasps]

495
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:18,673
My vengeance will be swift and true.

496
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:21,509
As will mine.

497
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:23,887
[arcane power pulses]

498
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,722
Goody Addams.

499
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,600
You haunt me still.

500
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:31,728
You will suffer the same fate
you bequeathed me.

501
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,775
Now burn in the eternal fires of hell.

[grunting weakly]

505
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,960
[Laurel] Sweet dreams, Wednesday!

506
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:07,931
I can't believe you're in a secret society
and you didn't tell me.

507
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:11,017
Because, you know,

508
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,394
it's secret.

509
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:16,856
[Enid] Bianca, Davina…

510
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:18,983
and Kent?

511
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,110
Seriously, even Kent is here?

512
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:23,446
How exclusive is this club?

513
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,907
So, what's the deal
with Thornhill being a psycho?

514
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:29,035
She murdered Weems and then took
Wednesday to Crackstone's crypt.

515
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:32,789
We have to get everyone in the school
to safety before it's too late.

516
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:34,123
[Ajax] This is what's coming.

517
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,376
[Kent] So do we pull the fire alarms?

518
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:39,087
We don't want to cause a panic
and alert Tyler or Thornhill.

519
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,548
So how do we get everyone out?

520
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,759
We'll use our siren song to convince them.

521
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,810
Thing and I will go look for Wednesday.

522
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:56,646
Okay, Nightshades forever.

[all snap in unison]

524
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,734
Seriously, a secret snap too?

[ominous music playing]

526
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,036
[faint voice] Wednesday.

527
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,500
Are you here to take me to the other side?

528
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:21,004
Listen, Crackstone must be stabbed
through his black heart.

529
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,632
It is the only way
he will be vanquished now and forever.

530
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,510
Is your spectral vision impaired?
I'm dying.

531
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,429
Your necklace.

532
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:30,847
It is a powerful talisman.

533
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:35,018
My mother told me
it's for conjuring visions.

534
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:37,395
It is also a conduit
for conjuring spirits.

535
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:40,690
It will allow me
to pass through you and heal you.

536
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:43,902
Just know, once I do,
you will never see me again.

537
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,613
The school needs you, Wednesday.

-You tracking your little monster?
-You shut it.

545

Hey, wait. Wait!

Oh, you asshole!

Come on, let's move quickly

I'm feeling much better now.

566

You're like a cockroach.

567
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:03,291

I need to get back to the school.

I can't tell you
how I've longed for this moment,

what it means for my family.

581

[distorted] Silence, woman!

Stay away from her!

It's probably the first smart decision
you've made today.

629
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,836
I might not get to kill all the outcasts,

630

Wednesday.

[footsteps approaching]

653
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:29,833
I hate to admit,

654
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,211
but I am gonna miss Principal Weems.

655
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,630
She could be a real pain.

656
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:38,550
But she was tough.

657
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:42,971
And she died for the one thing
she truly loved, this school.

658
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,601
For that, I have immense respect.

659
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:50,646
[Enid] She was one of us.

660
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:04,034
Now that classes are canceled
for the semester,

661
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:06,453
you have to come visit me
in San Francisco.

662
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:09,289
I can pretty much guarantee
fog and drizzle every day.

663
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,541
Sounds tempting.

So don't let killing one
supernatural pilgrim get to your head.

I hear you're a free man now.

669

Yup. All charges dismissed.

00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:06,472
Listen.

671
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:09,308
When I was in the cell
I said a lot of… things.

672
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,728
Being your friend
should come with a warning label.

673
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:17,191
But… I don't know a lot of people
who would take an arrow for me. So…

No, never.

680

I'd settle for a text, though.

You know what a text is, right?

682
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,055
