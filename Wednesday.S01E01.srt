to send me here.

179
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:42,243
It's all a part of their nefarious,
yet completely obvious plan.

180
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:43,369
What plan?

181
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,038
To turn me into a version of themselves.

182
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:49,375
In that case,
perhaps you can clear something up.

183
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,545
Rumor's been swirling around
that you killed a kid at your old school,

184
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,505
and your parents pulled strings
to get you off.

185
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:56,841
Actually, it was two kids,
but who's counting?

186
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,638
Welcome to the quad.

187
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,101
It's a pentagon.

188
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:12,022
The whole snarky Goth girl thing
might have worked at normie school,

189
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,733
but here things are different.

190
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,944
Let me give you a wiki
on Nevermore's social scene.

191
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:20,865
I'm not interested in participating
in tribal adolescent clichés.

192
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:24,618
Well, then use it to fill
your obviously bottomless pit of disdain.

193
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,954
There are many flavors of outcasts here,

194
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:30,207
but the four main cliques are
Fangs, Furs, Stoners and Scales.

195
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,378
Those are the Fangs, AKA vampires.

196
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:37,465
Some of them have literally
been here for decades.

197
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:41,677
That bunch of knuckleheads are Furs,
AKA werewolves.

198
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,971
-Like me!
-[Furs howling]

199
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:46,348
Full moons get pretty loud around here.

200
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,641
That's when Furs wolf out.

201
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,186
I suggest you pick up
noise-cancelling headphones.

202
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,313
I'm assuming Scales are sirens?

203
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,148
[Enid] You catch on quick.

204
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,858
And that girl, Bianca Barclay,

205
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,611
is the closest thing
Nevermore has to royalty.

[enchanting whooshing]

207
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,782
Although her crown's been slipping lately.

208
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,868
She used to date our resident
tortured artist, Xavier Thorpe.

209
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,204
But they broke up
at the beginning of the semester.

210
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,039
Reason unknown.

211
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,249
-Fascinating.
-I know, right?

212
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,711
My vlog is, like, the number one source
for Nevermore gossip.

213
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,340
Yo, Enid! You're not gonna believe
the dirt I heard about your new roommate.

214
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,550
She eats human flesh.

215
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,552
Chowed down on that kid she murdered.

216
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,262
You better watch your back.

217
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,473
Quite the contrary.

218
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,433
I actually fillet
the bodies of my victims,

219
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,644
then feed them to my menagerie of pets.

220
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,731
Ajax, this is my new roommate, Wednesday.

221
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:37,900
Whoa.

222
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,277
You're in black and white.

223
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,322
-Like a living Instagram filter.
-Ignore him.

224
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,491
Gorgons spend way too much time
getting stoned.

225
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,201
He's cute, but clueless.

226
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,703
It's a small school.
There wasn't much online about you.

227
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,540
You should really get on Insta,
Snapchat and TikTok.

228
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:57,378
I find social media to be a soul-sucking
void of meaningless affirmation.

229
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,804
Look at you, my little deathtrap.

230
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:11,141
Seeing you in this uniform brings back
so many terrible memories.

231
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,060
-Doesn't it, Tish?
-Yes.

232
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,814
Why don't you boys wait in the car?

233
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,191
Wednesday and I need a moment.

[Pugsley grunts]

235
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,324
Pugsley,

236
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,327
you're soft and weak.

237
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:33,956
You'll never survive without me.
I give you two months, tops.

238
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,458
I'm gonna miss you, too, sis.

239
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:47,553
Any plans you have of running away
end right now.

240
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,848
I've alerted all family members

241
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:54,685
to contact me
the minute you darken their doorstep.

242
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,813
You have nowhere to go.

243
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,524
As usual, you underestimate me, Mother.

244
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,652
I will escape
this educational penitentiary,

245
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,696
and you will never hear from me again.

[sighs]

247
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,991
You are a brilliant girl, Wednesday,

248
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,243
but sometimes you get in your own way.

249
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:16,916
I'm sure you'll grow to love Nevermore,

250
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:21,295
and find it as life-changing as I did.

251
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:26,967
Oh, I got you a little something.

00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,763

It's made of obsidian,

256
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,774
which Aztec priests
used to conjure visions.

257
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,319
It's a symbol of our connection.

258
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,158
Which one of your spirits
suggested this toe-curling tchotchke?

I'm not you, Mother.

00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:58,582
I will never fall in love,
or be a housewife, or have a family.

00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:04,546
I'm told girls your age
say hurtful things,

262
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,799
and I shouldn't take it to heart.

263

Well, the torso and arm are over there.

We found a leg by the lake.

278
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,639
There's an arm in that tree over there,

279
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,350
and the rest of the parts
are so far unaccounted for.

280
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,771
It matches the profile
of the other two attacks last week.

All right, issue a warning.
Keep hikers out of the woods.

It's a brisk 25-minute walk,
or there's a shuttle on the weekends.

The locals are a tad bit wary
about Nevermore,

so please don't go making any waves,
or perpetuating any outcast stereotypes.

and no smothering people in their sleep.

520
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:55,121
and suggested I seek psychiatric help.

521
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,205
[Kinbott] Hmm.

522
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,498
Ironic, isn't it?

523
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,542
How did you take that?

524
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,670

I'm glad to hear that.

Because I was sent the manuscripts
as part of your psych evaluation.

The relationship I found most intriguing

531
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,608
was that of Viper
and her mother, Dominica.

Why don't we dig into that?

533

It's four shots of espresso.

562
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,687
Yeah, I… I know what a quad is,

563
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:28,232
but, spoiler alert,
the espresso machine's having a seizure,

564
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,567
so all we have is drip.

565
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,778

00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,930
Of course.
It's the native tongue of Machiavelli.

Here's the deal.
I'm going to fix your coffee machine,

I'd become a lone wolf.

701
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:22,474
Sounds perfect.

702
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:25,811
Are you kidding me?
My life would be officially over.

703
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:29,690

It was the week after Halloween.

712

I was six years old.

713
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:09,730
I took my pet scorpion, Nero,
out for his afternoon stroll,

714
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,065

00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:40,068
[all screaming]

871
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:41,778
[Wednesday] <i>You insisted</i>
<i>I go to this school.</i>

872
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:44,281
<i>Did you really think</i>
<i>I wouldn't find out your secret? </i>

873
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:45,657
You don't know the full story.

874
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:49,494
When I suggested giving
your side of the room a makeover,

875
00:54:49,577 --> 00:54:52,998
I did not have
Ted Bundy's Pinterest in mind. Ew.

876
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:56,084
[Wednesday] <i>This ends now.</i>

877
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:58,003
[dramatic music intensifies]

878
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,593
If you hear me screaming bloody murder,

879
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:07,595
there's a good chance
I'm just enjoying myself.

880
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:10,265
[narrator] <i>Watch all episodes now.</i>

881
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:14,978
[jauntily macabre outro music playing]
