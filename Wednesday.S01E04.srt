00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,844
Cut me loose and go run with the pack.

176
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:39,889
Are you sure?

177
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:53,027
I'm going to see Galpin. I'm not stop--

178
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,280
[grandiose, elegant music playing]

179
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,618
[door chimes ring]

180
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,536
Hi, Wednesday.

181
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,374
That dress will certainly turn some heads.

182
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,378
Are you collecting more
exotic trinkets for your office?

183
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,254
Those are souvenirs from my travels.

184
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,423
That's how I step outside of
my comfort zone.

185
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:18,427
Speaking of which, are you going
to the Rave'N this weekend?

186
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:21,430
I'm not required to answer
your questions out in the wild, am I?

187
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:25,059
I look forward to talking about it
at our next session.

188
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,278
We both know
that there's a monster out there.

189
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,697
If we're going to stop it,

190
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:41,033
I think it's time we put
our differences aside and work together.

191
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,285
And this is your stake
for me to deal you in?

192
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,291
[Galpin sighs]

193
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:53,045
I'm sorry, you gotta do better than that.
You got some nice detail though.

194
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,214
-I didn't draw it.
-I need to know who did.

195
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:58,008
Unless we're exchanging intel,
I'm not at liberty to say.

196
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,929
Why would I share information
about an ongoing murder investigation

197
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,264
with a high school kid?

198
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:05,474
Because I go to Nevermore and you don't.

199
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,394
Don't you want eyes and ears
behind those ivy-covered walls?

200
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:12,773
Listen, Velma, why don't you
and the Scooby gang stick to your homework

201
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,608
and leave investigating
to the professionals.

202
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:15,526
[phone ringing]

203
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:18,320
-What?
-[woman] <i>Mayor Walker's on line two.</i>

204
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,906
-<i>He's looking for an update.</i>
-Hey, Addams.

205
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,201
Let me see that sketch again.

206
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,580
[suspenseful music playing]

207
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,876
The person who drew this,
that your suspect?

208
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:38,591
When you bring me some concrete evidence,
maybe we'll talk.

209
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:42,720
Yes, Mayor. Everything's going splendidly.

210
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,472
[indistinct chatter]

211
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,599
[student] My spiky little sea urchin.

212
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,602
-That's horrible.
-That's actually her singing.

213
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:50,686
[chatter subsides]

214
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,110
Is it okay if I talk to Enid?

215
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,365
[Enid] Don't worry. I can handle him.

216
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:08,496
Thanks.

217
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,208
-I'm--
-Lucas Walker, mayor's son.

218
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,710
Recently split from cheer captain,
Chrissy Smothers.

219
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,505
Cute brunette who needs
to rethink her spray tan.

220
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:18,631
That's kinda scary.

221
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,926
I have a nose for gossip
and I follow half your grade on TikTok.

222
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,845
Oh yeah, and my roommate
kicked your butt… twice.

223
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,682
-Wednesday Addams is your roommate?
-Sure is.

224
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,560
I know this isn't a random encounter.

225
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,396
So, why are you sitting here,
Lucas Walker?

226
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,482
You must want something.

227
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,776
I've got a friend
who works at Hawte Kewture.

228
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:41,362
She overheard you're on the hunt
for a date to the Rave'N.

229
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,989
Maybe we can help each other out.

230
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,580
Don't want to ask
what trouble you're in now.

231
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,457
Nothing I can't handle.

232
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:57,044
Your father's in particularly
frustrating form today. Avoid.

233
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,755
Yeah, welcome to my world.

234
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,049
You guys have the Rave'N
this weekend, right?

235
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,593
It was all the buzz
at the Weathervane today.

236
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,596
I must be the only one
not obsessed with this stupid dance.

237
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,849
So, you're not going?

238
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,563
Actually, I was forced to ask someone
as an act of self-preservation.

239
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,316
Sure, that happens, I guess.

240
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,276
So, who is it?

241
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,528
[restrained, poignant music playing]

242
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:23,612
Xavier.

243
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:26,699
Got it.

244
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,410
Hope you two have fun.

245
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:32,663
-I'm not sure why you're upset.
-That's kind of the problem.

246
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:36,250
I mean, call me crazy, Wednesday,
but you keep giving me these signals.

247
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,545
It's not my fault I can't interpret
your emotional Morse code.

248
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,463
Then let me spell it out.

249
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,466
I thought we liked each other,

250
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:48,512
but then you pull something like this,
and I have no idea where I stand.

251
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,890
Am I in the "more-than-friend zone"

252
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,100
or just a pawn
in some game you're playing?

253
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,978
I'm just dealing with a lot right now.

254
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,022
I need to prioritize.

255
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,278
Thanks for clearing that up.

256
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,741
I guess, give me a call
if I ever move up your to-do list.

257
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,498
[forcefully] Not one word.

258
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,296
[bees buzzing]

259
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:35,017
Enid wouldn't let me
keep this in our dorm.

260
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,853
No worries. <i>Mi colmena es su colmena</i>.

261
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:43,275
I assume this is the creature
that's been rampaging in the woods.

262
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,736
You've heard about it before?

263
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:49,573
Rumors. Mr. Fitts banned me
from bug-hunting until further notice.

264
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,619
Claimed a bear was on the loose,
which I knew was a lie.

265
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,621
Didn't match their hibernation schedules.

266
00:15:56,747 --> 00:16:01,251
Speaking of monsters with sharp claws,
could you give this to your roomie?

267
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,586
Put in a good word for me?

268
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,880
I hear she's still sans date
for the Rave'N.

269
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,090
Eugene.

270
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:10,594
I know the chances of her asking me
are next to zero, but I don't care.

271
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:14,139
I'll keep putting myself out there
until Enid finally… sees me.

272
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:15,975
And if she never does?

273
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,267
She will.

274
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,894
I'm playing the long game.

275
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,355
My moms say people
will appreciate me when I'm older.

276
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:23,691
They're probably just trying
to make me feel better, but--

277
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:26,443
Listen, people like me and you,
we're different.

278
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:30,781
We're original thinkers, intrepid outliers
in this vast cesspool of adolescence.

279
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:33,951
We don't need these inane
rites of passage to validate who we are.

280
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,453
So you're not going to the Rave'N either?

281
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,457
Actually, I am.

282
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,084
With Xavier.

283
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,294
I see.

284
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,213
It's not like I like Xavier.

285
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,133
I just have ulterior motives.

286
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:53,137
Sketches are the closest thing I have
to a lead to try and stop this thing.

287
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,809
[Eugene] That circle…

288
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:00,269
I think I know where that is.

289
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,270
Show me.

290
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,149
[eerie music playing]

291
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:06,900
[Wednesday] It's definitely a match.

292
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,569
What were you doing out here?

293
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:09,820
Collecting specimens.

294
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:12,781
This place is ground zero
for horny gypsy moths.

295
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,492
You think it's in there?

296
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:16,827
Only one way to find out.

297
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,834
[eerie music continues]

298
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:26,712
I'm not a huge fan of enclosed spaces.

299
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,005
I'm claustrophobic.

300
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,008
If you hear me screaming bloody murder,

301
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,427
there's a good chance
I'm just enjoying myself.

302
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,097
[Eugene sighs]

303
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,811
[sighs]

304
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,444
[Wednesday] This is definitely its lair.

305
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,405
[Eugene] Are those human?

306
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,576
No, I think it's got a taste for venison.

307
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,875
Check this out.

308

[chilling music playing]

309
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:17,971
Yahtzee.

310
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,309
What is that?

311
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,061
Concrete proof.

312
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,366
All right, I won't be long.

313
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:41,036
I just need to find something
to match against the claw's DNA.

314
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,552
[tense coda plays]

315

[chilling music playing]

316
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,409
What are you doing?

317
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,370
How do you know
what the monster looks like?

318
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,206
Or are these all just self-portraits?

319
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,001
[scoffs] What, you think it's me?
I saved your life.

320
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:32,337
So did the monster. Or was that you
the night Rowan was killed?

321
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,923
-You so are out of line now.
-I'm trying to uncover the truth.

322
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,426
And your art seems
to have a recurring motif.

323
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,096
Yeah.

324
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:44,975
This creature's been haunting
my dreams for weeks.

325
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:49,563
I try to block it out, but I can't.
So I just… come in here and paint it.

326
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:53,525
When I was painting this one,
claws reached out and took a swipe at me.

327
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,235
That's how I got these.

328
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,405
I thought you were able
to control your ability.

329
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:02,075
-Not when it comes to this.
-Maybe it's your guilty conscience.

330
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,036
I told you I'm not the monster, okay?

331
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,375
You just happened to draw pictures of it,

332
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,294
down to the location of its lair
in the woods?

333
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:14,880
Those are some pretty vivid dreams.

334
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,090
You were in here.

335
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,010
Before, when I caught you outside.

336
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,305
That's the only reason
you asked me to the Rave'N?

337
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,059
[scoffs] To try and cover.

338
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,813
-You are unbelievable.
-It's nothing personal.

339
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,398
No, it never is with you, is it?

340
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:37,486
I mean, do you even care about anyone
or anything at all, Wednesday?

341
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:41,907
Get out!

342
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:58,340
Yeah, I know Inez
is usually three sheets to the wind,

343
00:20:58,423 --> 00:20:59,841
